<p><span class="bold">CHARIOT<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (derived from an O. Fr. word, formed from <i>char</i>, a car),
in antiquity, a conveyance (Gr. <span class="grk" title="arma">&#7941;&#961;&#956;&#945;</span>, Lat. <i>currus</i>)
used in battle, for the chase, in public processions and in games. The
Greek chariot had two wheels, and was made to be drawn by two
horses; if a third or, more commonly, two reserve horses were
added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a
single trace fastened to the front of the chariot, as may be seen
on two prize vases in the British Museum from the Panathenaic
games at Athens. On the monuments there is no other sign of
traces, from the want of which wheeling round must have been difficult.
Immediately on the axle (<span class="grk" title="axôn">&#7940;&#958;&#969;&#957;</span>, <i>axis</i>), without springs
of any kind, rested the basket or body (<span class="grk" title="diphros">&#948;&#943;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) of the chariot,
which consisted of a floor to stand on, and a semicircular guard
round the front about half the height of the driver. It was
entirely open at the back, so that the combatant might readily
leap to the ground and up again as was necessary. There was no
seat, and generally only room for the combatant and his charioteer
to stand in. The pole (<span class="grk" title="rumos">&#8165;&#965;&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>, <i>temo</i>) was probably attached to
the middle of the axle, though it appears to spring from the front of the
basket; at the end of the pole was the yoke (<span class="grk" title="zygon">&#950;&#965;&#947;&#8056;&#957;</span>, <i>jugum</i>),
which consisted of two small saddles fitting the necks of the horses,
and fastened by broad bands round the chest. Besides this the
harness of each horse consisted of a bridle and a pair of reins,
mostly the same as in use now, made of leather and ornamented
with studs of ivory or metal. The reins were passed through
rings attached to the collar bands or yoke, and were long enough
to be tied round the waist of the charioteer in case of his having
to defend himself. The wheels and body of the chariot were
usually of wood, strengthened in places with bronze or iron; the
wheels had from four to eight spokes and tires of bronze or iron.
This description applies generally to the chariots of all the nations
of antiquity; the differences consisted chiefly in the mountings.
The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the
bow was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with
quivers full of arrows, while those of the Greeks, whose characteristic
weapon was the spear, were plain except as regards mere
decoration. Among the Persians, again, and more remarkably
among the ancient Britons, there was a class of chariot having
the wheels mounted with sharp, sickle-shaped blades, which cut
to pieces whatever came in their way. This was probably an
invention of the Persians; Cyrus the younger employed these
chariots in large numbers. Among the Greeks and Romans, on
the other hand, the chariot had passed out of use in war before
historical times, and was retained only for races in the public
games, or for processions, without undergoing any alteration
apparently, its form continuing to correspond with the description
of Homer, though it was lighter in build, having to carry
only the charioteer. On two Panathenaic prize vases in the
British Museum are figures of racing <i>bigae</i>, in which, contrary
to the description given above, the driver is seated with his feet
resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of his
horses. The <i>biga</i> itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with
a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. The
chariot was unsuited to the uneven soil of Greece and Italy, and
it is not improbable that these nations had brought it with them
as part of their original habits from their former seats in the
East. In the remains of Egyptian and Assyrian art there are
numerous representations of chariots, from which it may be
seen with what richness they were sometimes ornamented. The
&ldquo;iron&rdquo; chariots in use among the Jews appear to have been
chariots strengthened or plated with metal, and no doubt were
of the form above described, which prevailed generally among
the other ancient nations. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carriage</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARITY AND CHARITIES.<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> The word &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; or love,
represents the principle of the good life. It stands for a mood
or habit of mind and an endeavour. From it, as a habit of mind,
springs the social and personal endeavour which in the widest
sense we may call charity. The two correspond. Where the
habit of mind has not been gained, the endeavour fluctuates
and is relatively purposeless. In so far as it has been gained,
the endeavour is founded on an intelligent scrutiny of social
conditions and guided by a definite purpose. In the one case
it is realized that some social theory must be found by us, if
our action is to be right and consistent; in the other case no
need of such a theory is felt. This article is based on the assumption
that there are principles in charity or charitable work, and
that these can be ascertained by a study of the development
of social conditions, and their relation to prevalent social aims
and religious or philosophic conceptions. It is assumed also
that the charity of the religious life, if rightly understood, cannot
be inconsistent with that of the social life.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Perhaps some closer definition of charity is necessary. The words
that signify goodwill towards the community and its members are
primarily words expressive of the affections of family life in the
relations existing between parents, and between parent and child.
As will be seen, the analogies underlying such phrases as &ldquo;God the
Father,&rdquo; &ldquo;children of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; have played a great part
in the development of charitable thought in pre-Christian as well
as in Christian days. The germ, if we may say so, of the words <span class="grk" title="philia,
agapê">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;, &#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>, <i>amor</i>, love; <i>amicitia</i>, friendship, is the sexual or the
parental relation. With the realization of the larger life in man the
meaning of the word expands. <i>Caritas</i>, or charity, strikes another
note&mdash;high price, and thus dearness. It is charity, indeed, expressed
in mercantile metaphor; and it would seem that it was associated
in thought with the word <span class="grk" title="charis">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span>, which has also a commercial
meaning, but signifies as well favour, gratitude, grace, kindness. Partly
thus, perhaps, it assumed and suggested a nobler conception; and
sometimes, as, for instance, in English ecclesiastical documents, it
was spelt <i>charitas</i>. <span class="grk" title="Agapê">&#902;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>, which in the Authorized Version of the
Bible is translated charity, was used by St Paul as a translation of
the Hebrew word <i>h&#275;s&#275;d</i>, which in the Old Testament is in the same
version translated &ldquo;mercy&rdquo;&mdash;as in Hosea vi. 6, &ldquo;I desired mercy,
and not sacrifice.&rdquo; This word represents the charity of kindness
and goodness, as distinguished from almsgiving. Almsgiving,
<i>&#351;ed&#257;q&#257;h</i>, is translated by the word <span class="grk" title="eleêmosunê">&#7952;&#955;&#949;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#973;&#957;&#951;</span> in the
Septuagint, and in the Authorized Version by the word &ldquo;righteousness.&rdquo; It
represents the deed or the gift which is due&mdash;done or made, not spontaneously,
but under a sense of religious obligation. In the earlier
Christian period the word almsgiving has this meaning, and was in
that sense applied to a wide range of actions and contracts, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page861" id="page861"></a>861</span>
a gift to a beggar at a church door to a grant and a tenure of land.
It also, in the word almoner, represented the fulfilment of the
religious obligation with the aid of an agent or delegate. The words
charity or love (<i>caritas</i> or <span class="grk" title="agapê">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>), on the other hand, without losing
the tone with which the thought of parental or family love inspires
them, assume a higher meaning. In religious thought they imply
an ideal life, as represented by such expressions as &ldquo;love (<i>agape</i>)
of God.&rdquo; This on the one side; and on the other an ideal social
relation, in such words as &ldquo;love of man.&rdquo; Thus in the word
&ldquo;charity&rdquo; religious and social associations meet; and thus regarded
the word means a disciplined and habitual mood in which the mind
is considerate of the welfare of others individually and generally,
and devises what is for their real good, and in which the intelligence
and the will strive to fulfil the mind&rsquo;s purpose. Charity thus has
no necessary relation to relief or alms. To give a lecture, or to nurse
a sick man who is not in want or &ldquo;poor,&rdquo; may be equally a deed
of charity; though in fact charity concerns itself largely with the
classes usually called &ldquo;the poor,&rdquo; and with problems of distress and
relief. Relief, however, is not an essential part of charity or charitable
work. It is one of many means at its disposal. If the world
were so poor that no one could make a gift, or so wealthy that no one
needed it, charity&mdash;the charity of life and of deeds&mdash;would remain.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of charity is a history of many social and religious
theories, influences and endeavours, that have left their mark
alike upon the popular and the cultivated thought of the present
day. The inconsistencies of charitable effort and argument
may thus in part be accounted for. To understand the problem
of charity we have therefore (1) to consider the stages of charitable
thought&mdash;the primitive, pagan, Greek and Roman, Jewish
and Christian elements, that make up the modern consciousness
in regard to charity, and also the growth of the habit of &ldquo;charity&rdquo;
as representing a gradually educated social instinct. (2) We
have also to consider in their relation to charity the results of
recent investigations of the conditions of social life. (3) At
each stage we have to note the corresponding stage of practical
administration in public relief and private effort&mdash;for the division
between public or &ldquo;poor-law&rdquo; relief and charity which prevails
in England is, comparatively speaking, a novelty, and, generally
speaking, the work of charity can hardly be appreciated or
understood if it be considered without reference to public
relief. (4) As to the present day, we have to consider practical
suggestions in regard to such subjects as charity and economic
thought, charity organization, friendly visiting and almonership,
co-operation with the poor-law, charity and thrift, parochial
management, hospitals and medical relief, exceptional distress
and the &ldquo;unemployed,&rdquo; the utilization of endowments and their
supervision, and their adaptation to new needs and emergencies.
(5) We have also throughout to consider charitable help in
relation to classes of dependants, who appear early in the history
of the question&mdash;widows and orphans, the sick and the aged,
vagrants and wayfarers.</p>

<p>First in the series come the charities of the family and of
hospitality; then the wider charities of religion, the charities
of the community, and of individual donors and of mutual help.
These gradually assumed importance in communities which
consisted originally of self-supporting classes, within which
widows and orphans, for instance, would be rather provided for,
in accordance with recognized class obligations, than relieved.
Then come habitual almsgiving, the charitable endowment, and
the modern charitable institution and association. But throughout
the test of progress or decadence appears to be the condition
of the family. The family is the source, the home and the
hearthstone of charity. It has been created but slowly, and
there is naturally a constant tendency to break away from its
obligations and to ignore and depreciate its utility. Yet the
family, as we now have it, is itself the outcome of infinite thought
working through social instinct, and has at each stage of its
development indicated a general advance. To it, therefore,
constant reference must be made.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part I.&mdash;primitive Charity</p>

<p>The study of early communities has brought to light the history
of the development of the family. &ldquo;Marriage in its lowest
phases is by no means a matter of affection or companionship&rdquo;;
and only very slowly has the position of both parents been
recognized as implying different but correlative responsibilities
towards their child. Only very slowly, also, has the morality
necessary to the making of the family been won. Charity at
earlier stages is hardly recognized as a virtue, nor infanticide
as an evil. Hospitality&mdash;the beginning of a larger social life&mdash;is
non-existent. The self-support of the community is secured
by marriage, and when relations fail marriage becomes a provision
against poverty. Then by the tribal system is created
another safeguard against want. But apart also from these
methods of maintenance, at a very early stage there is charitable
relief. The festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, and of
the seasons, are the occasions for sacrifice and relief; and, as
Christmas customs prove, the instinct to give help or alms at
such festival periods still remains. Charity is concerned primarily
with certain elemental forces of social life: the relation
between these primitive instincts and impulses that still influence
charity should not, therefore, be overlooked. The basis of
social life is also the basis of charitable thought and action.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The savage is the civilized man in the rough. &ldquo;The lowest races
have,&rdquo; Lord Avebury writes, &ldquo;no institution of marriage.&rdquo; Many
have no word for &ldquo;dear&rdquo; or &ldquo;beloved.&rdquo; The child belongs to the
tribe rather than to the parent. In these circumstances a problem
of charity such as the following may arise:&mdash;&ldquo;Am I to starve, while
my sister has children whom she can sell?&rdquo; a question asked of
Burton by a negro. From the point of view of the tribe, an able-bodied
man would be more valuable than dependent children, and
the relationship of the larger family of brothers and sisters would
be a truer claim to help than that of mother and child. Subsequently
the child is recognized as related, not to the father, but to the
mother, and there is &ldquo;a kind of bond which lasts for life between
mother and child, although the father is a stranger to it.&rdquo; Slowly
only is the relative position of both parents, with different but correlative
responsibilities, recognized. The first two steps of charity
have then been made: the social value of the bond between the
mother, and then between the father, and the child has been recognized.
Until this point is reached the morality necessary to the
making of the family is wanting, and for a long time afterwards it
is hardly won. The virtue of chastity&mdash;the condition precedent to
the higher family life&mdash;is unrecognized. Indeed, the set of such
religious thought as there may be is against it. Abstract conceptions,
even in the nobler races, are lacking. The religion of life is vaguely
struggling with its animality, and that which it at last learns to rule
it at first worships. In these circumstances there is little charity
for the child and little for the stranger. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Dr Schweinfurth
wrote in his <i>Heart of Africa</i>, &ldquo;an utter want of wholesome
intercourse between race and race. For any member of a tribe that
speaks one dialect to cross the borders of a tribe that speaks another
is to make a venture at the hazard of his life.&rdquo; The religious obligations
that fostered and sanctified family life among the Greeks and
Romans and Jews are unknown. Much later in development comes
charity for the child, with the abhorrence of infanticide&mdash;against
which the Jewish-Christian charity of 2000 years ago uttered its
most vigorous protests. If the child belonged primarily to the tribe
or state, its maintenance or destruction was a common concern.
This motive influenced the Greeks, who are historically nearer the
earlier forms of social life than ourselves. For the common good they
exposed the deformed child; but also &ldquo;where there were too many,
for in our state population has a limit,&rdquo; as Aristotle says, &ldquo;the babe
or unborn child was destroyed.&rdquo; And so, to lighten their own
responsibilities, parents were wont to do in the slow years of the
degradation of the Roman empire, though the interest of the state
then required a contrary policy. The transition to our present
feeling of responsibility for child-life has been very gradual and
uncertain, through the middle ages and even till the 18th century.
Strictly it may be said that all penitentiaries and other similar
institutions are concrete protests on behalf of a better family life.
The movement for the care of children in the 18th century naturally
and instinctively allied itself with the penitentiary movement. The
want of regard for child-life, when the rearing of children becomes
a source of economic pressure, suggests why in earlier stages of
civilization all that charitable apparatus which we now think necessary
for the assistance of children is wanting, even if the need, so far
as it does arise, is not adequately met by the recognized obligations
of the clan-family or brotherhood.</p>

<p>In the case of barbarous races charity and self-support may be
considered from some other points of view. Self-support is secured
in two ways&mdash;by marriage and by slavery. &ldquo;For a man or woman
to be unmarried after the age of thirty is unheard of&rdquo; (T.H. Lewin,
<i>Wild Races of South-East India</i>). On the other hand, if any one is
without a father, mother or other relative, and destitute of the
necessaries of life, he may sell himself and become a slave. Thus
slavery becomes a provision for poverty when relations fail. The
clan-family may serve the same purpose. David Livingstone describes
the formation of the clan-family among the Bakuena. &ldquo;Each
man, by virtue of paternity, is chief of his own children. They build
huts round his.... Near the centre of each circle of huts is a spot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page862" id="page862"></a>862</span>
called a &lsquo;kotla,&rsquo; with a fireplace; here they work, eat, &amp;c. A poor
man attaches himself to the &lsquo;kotla&rsquo; of a rich one, and is considered
a child of the latter.&rdquo; Thus the clan-family is also a poor-relief
association.</p>

<p>Studies in folklore bring to light many relations between the
charity of the old world and that of our own day.</p>
</div>

<p>In regard to the charity of the early community, we may take
the 8th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> as the point of departure. The <i>Odyssey</i>
(about 800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Hesiod (about 700 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) are
roughly parallel with Amos (816-775), and represent
<span class="sidenote">The early community.</span>
two streams of thought that meet in the early Christian
period. The period covered by the <i>Odyssey</i> seems to
merge into that of Hesiod. We take the former first, dealing
with the clan-family and the phratry, which are together the
self-maintaining unit of society, with the general relief of the
poor, with hospitality, and with vagrancy. In Hesiod we find
the customary law of charity in the earlier community definitely
stated, and also indications of the normal methods of neighbourly
help which were in force in country districts. First of the family
and brotherhood, or phratry. The family (<i>Od</i>. viii. 582) included
alike the wife&rsquo;s father and the daughter&rsquo;s husband. It was thus
a clanlike family. Out of this was developed the phratry or
brotherhood, in which were included alike noble families, peasants
and craftsmen, united by a common worship and responsibilities
and a common customary law (<i>themis</i>). Zeus, the god of social
life, was worshipped by the phratry. He was the father of the
law (<i>themis</i>). He was god of host and guest. Society was thus
based on law, the brotherhood and the family. The irresponsible
man, the man worthy of no respect or consideration, was one
who belonged to no brotherhood, was subject to no customary
law, and had no hearth or family. The phratry was, and became
afterwards still more, &ldquo;a natural gild.&rdquo; Outside the self-sustaining
phratry was the stranger, including the wayfarer and
the vagrant; and partly merged in these classes was the beggar,
the recognized recipient of the alms of the community. To
change one&rsquo;s abode and to travel was assumed to be a cause of
reproach (<i>Il</i>. ix. 648). The &ldquo;land-louper&rdquo; was naturally suspected.
On the other hand, a stranger&rsquo;s first thought in a new
country was whether the inhabitants were wild or social (<span class="grk" title="dikaioi">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span>),
hospitable and God-fearing (<i>Od</i>. xiii. 201). Hospitality thus
became the first public charity; Zeus sent all strangers and
beggars, and it was against all law (<span class="grk" title="themis">&#952;&#941;&#956;&#953;&#962;</span>) to slight them. Out
of this feeling&mdash;a kind of glorified almsgiving&mdash;grew up the
system of hospitality in Greek states and also in the Roman
world. The host greeted the stranger (or the suppliant). An
oath of friendship was taken by the stranger, who was then
received with the greeting, Welcome (<span class="grk" title="chaire">&#967;&#945;&#8150;&#961;&#949;</span>), and water was
provided for ablution, and food and shelter. In the larger
house there was a guests&rsquo; table. In the hut he shared the peasant&rsquo;s
meal. The custom bound alike the rich and the poor. On parting
presents were given, usually food for the onward journey,
sometimes costly gifts. The obligation was mutual, that the
host should give hospitality, and that the guest should not abuse
it. From early times tallies were exchanged between them as
evidence of this formal relationship, which each could claim
again of the other by the production of the token. And further,
the relationship on either side became hereditary. Thus individuals
and families and tribes remained linked in friendship
and in the interchange of hospitalities.</p>

<p>Under the same patronage of Zeus and the same laws of
hospitality were vagrants and beggars. The vagrant and loafer
are sketched in the <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;the vagrant who lies glibly that he
may get entertainment, and the loafer who prefers begging to
work on a farm. These and the winter idlers, whom Hesiod
pictures&mdash;a group known to modern life&mdash;prefer at that season
to spend their time in the warmth of the village smithy, or at a
house of common resort (<span class="grk" title="leschê">&#955;&#941;&#963;&#967;&#951;</span>)&mdash;a common lodging-house,
we might say&mdash;where they would pass the night. Apparently,
as in modern times, the vagrants had organized their own system
of entertainment, and, supported by the public, were a class for
whom it was worth while to cater. The local or public beggars
formed a still more definite class. Their begging was a recognized
means of maintenance; it was a part of the method of poor
relief. Thus of Penelope it was said that, if Odysseus&rsquo; tale were
true, she would give him better clothes, and then he might beg
his bread throughout the country-side. Feasts, too, and almsgiving
were nearly allied, and feasts have always been one resource
for the relief of the poor. Thus naturally the beggars frequented
feasts, and were apparently a recognized and yet inevitable
nuisance. They wore, as part of their dress, scrips or wallets
in which they carried away the food they received, as later
Roman clients carried away portions of food in baskets (<i>sportula</i>)
from their patron&rsquo;s dinner. Odysseus, when he dresses up as a
beggar, puts on a wallet as part of his costume. Thus we find
a system of voluntary relief in force based on a recognition of the
duty of almsgiving as complete and peremptory as that which we
shall notice later among the Jews and the early Christians. We
are concerned with country districts, and not with towns, and,
as social conditions that are similar produce similar methods
of administration, so we find here a general plan of relief similar
to that which was in vogue in Scotland till the Scottish Poor Law
Act of 1845.</p>

<p>In Hesiod the fundamental conceptions of charity are more
clearly expressed. He has, if not his ten, at least his four
commandments, for disobedience to which Zeus will punish the
offender. They are: Thou shalt do no evil to suppliant or guest;
thou shalt not dishonour any woman of the family; thou shalt
not sin against the orphan; thou shalt not be unkind to aged
parents.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The laws of social life are thus duty to one&rsquo;s guest and duty to
one&rsquo;s family; and chastity has its true place in that relation, as the
later Greeks, who so often quote Hesiod (cf. the so-called <i>Economics</i>
of Aristotle), fully realized. Also the family charities due to the
orphan, whose lot is deplored in the <i>Iliad</i> (xxii. 490), and to the aged
are now clearly enunciated. But there is also in Hesiod the duty to
one&rsquo;s neighbour, not according to the &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; of &ldquo;Cristes
lore,&rdquo; but according to a law of honourable reciprocity in act and
intent. &ldquo;Love him who loves thee, and cleave to him who cleaveth
to thee: to him who would have given, give; to him who would not
have given, give not.&rdquo; The groundwork of Hesiod&rsquo;s charity outside
the family is neighbourly help (such as formed no small part of old
Scottish charity in the country districts); and he put his argument
thus: Competition, which is a kind of strife, &ldquo;lies in the roots of the
world and in men.&rdquo; It is good, and rouses the idle &ldquo;handless&rdquo; man
to work. On one side are social duty (<span class="grk" title="dikê">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</span>) and work, done briskly
at the right season of the year, which brings a full barn. On the other
side are unthrift and hunger, and relief with the disgrace of begging;
and the relief, when the family can do no more, must come from
neighbours, to whose house the beggar has to go with his wife and
children to ask for victual. Once they may be helped, or twice,
and then they will be refused. It is better, Hesiod tells his brother,
to work and so pay off his debts and avoid hunger (see <i>Erga</i>, 391,
&amp;c., and elsewhere). Here indeed is a problem of to-day as it
appeared to an early Greek. The alternatives before the idler&mdash;so
far as his own community is concerned&mdash;are labour with neighbourly
help to a limited extent, or hunger.</p>

<p>Hesiod was a farmer in Boeotia. Some 530 years afterwards a
pupil of Aristotle thus describes the district and its community of
farmers. &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;well to do, but simple in their
way of life. They practise justice, good faith, and hospitality.
To needy townsmen and vagabonds they give freely of their substance;
for meanness and covetousness are unknown to them.&rdquo;
The charitable method of Homeric and Hesiodic days still continued.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part II.&mdash;Charity among the Greeks</p>

<p>Society in a Greek state was divided into two parts, citizens
and slaves. The citizens required leisure for education, war
and government. The slaves were their ministers
and servants to enable them to secure this leisure.
<span class="sidenote">The Greek state.</span>
We have therefore to consider, on the one hand, the
position of the family and the clan-family, and the maintenance
of the citizen from public funds and by public and private
charities; and on the other hand the condition of the slaves,
and the relation between slavery and charity.</p>

<p>The slaves formed the larger part of the population. The
census of Attica, made between 317 and 307 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, gives their
numbers at 400,000 out of a population of about 500,000; and
even if this be considered excessive, the proportion of slaves
to citizens would certainly be very large. The citizens with their
wives and children formed some 12% of the community. Thus,
apart from the resident aliens, returned in the census at 10,000,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page863" id="page863"></a>863</span>
and their wives and children, we have two divisions of society:
the citizens, with their own organization of relief and charities;
and the slaves, permanently maintained by reason of their
dependence on individual members of the civic class. Thus,
there is no poverty but that of the poor citizens. Poverty is
limited to them. The slaves&mdash;that is to say, the bulk of the
labouring population&mdash;are provided for.</p>

<p>From times relatively near to Hesiod&rsquo;s we may trace the growth
and influence of the clan-family as the centre of customary
charity within the community, the gradual increase of a class of
poor either outside the clan-family or eventually independent
of it, and the development of a new organization of relief introduced
by the state to meet newer demands. We picture the
early state as a group of families, each of which tends to form
in time a separate group or clan. At each expansion from the
family to the clan the members of the clan retain rights and have
to fulfil duties which are the same as, or similar to, those which
prevailed in the family. Thus, in Attica the clan-families
(<i>genos</i>) and the brotherhoods (<i>phratria</i>) were &ldquo;the only basis of
legal rights and obligations over and above the natural family.&rdquo;
The clan-family was &ldquo;a natural guild,&rdquo; consisting of rich and
poor members&mdash;the well-born or noble and the craftsman alike.
Originally it would seem that the land was divided among the
families of the clan by lot and was inalienable. Thus with the
family was combined the means of supporting the family. On
the other hand, every youth was registered in his phratry, and
the phratry remained till the reforms of Cleisthenes (509 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
a political, and even after that time a social, organization of
importance.</p>

<p>First, as to the family&mdash;the mother and wife, and the father.
Already before the age of Plato and Xenophon (450-350 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
we find that the family has suffered a slow decline. The wife,
according to later Greek usage, was married as a child, hardly
educated, and confined to the house, except at some festival or
funeral. But with the decline came criticism and a nobler
conception of family life. &ldquo;First, then, come laws regarding
the wife,&rdquo; writes the author of the so-called <i>Economics</i> of Aristotle,
and the law, &ldquo;thou shalt do no wrong; for, if we do no
wrong, we shall not be wronged.&rdquo; This is the &ldquo;common law,&rdquo;
as the Pythagoreans say, &ldquo;and it implies that we must not wrong
the wife in the least, but treat her with the reverence due to a
suppliant, or one taken from the altar.&rdquo; The sanctity of marriage
is thus placed among the &ldquo;commandments&rdquo; of Hesiod, beside
the duty towards the stranger and the orphan. These and other
references to the Pythagoreans suggest that they, possibly in
common with other mystics, preached the higher religion of
marriage and social life, and thus inspired a deeper social feeling,
which eventually allied itself with the Christian movement.</p>

<p>Next, as to parents and children: the son was under an obligation
to support his father, subject, after Solon&rsquo;s time, to the
condition that he had taught him a trade; and after Solon&rsquo;s
time the father had no claim for support from an illegitimate
son. &ldquo;The possession of children,&rdquo; it was said (Arist. <i>Econ.</i>),
&ldquo;is not by nature for the public good only, but also for private
advantage. For what the strong may gain by their toil for the
weak, the weak in their old age receive from the strong... Thus
is the nature of each, the man and the woman, prearranged by the
Divine Being for a life in common.&rdquo; Honour to parents is &ldquo;the
first and greatest and oldest of all debts&rdquo; (Plato, <i>Laws</i>, 717).
The child has to care for the parent in his old age. &ldquo;Nemesis,
the minister of justice (<span class="grk" title="dikê">&#948;&#943;&#954;&#951;</span>), is appointed to watch over all these
things.&rdquo; And &ldquo;if a man fail to adorn the sepulchre of his dead
parents, the magistrates take note of it and inquire&rdquo; (Xen.
<i>Mem.</i> ii. 14). The heightened conception of marriage implies
a fuller interpretation of the mutual relations of parent and child
as well; both become sacred.</p>

<p>Then as to orphans. Before Solon&rsquo;s time (594 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the property
of any member of the clan-family who died without children
went to the clan; and after his time, when citizens were permitted
to leave their property by will, the property of an intestate fell
to the clan. This arrangement carried with it corresponding
duties. Through the clan-family provision was made for orphans.
Any member of the clan had the legal right to claim an orphan
member in marriage; and, if the nearest agnate did not marry
her, he had to give her a dowry proportionate to the amount of
his own property. Later, there is evidence of a growing sense of
responsibility in regard to orphans. Hippodamus (about 443
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), in his scheme of the perfected state (Arist. <i>Pol.</i> 1268),
suggested that there should be public magistrates to deal with
the affairs of orphans (and strangers); and Plato, his contemporary,
writes of the duty of the state and of the guardian towards
them very fully. Orphans, he proposes (<i>Laws</i>, 927), should be
placed under the care of public guardians. &ldquo;Men should have
a fear of the loneliness of orphans ... and of the souls of the
departed, who by nature take a special care of their own children....
A man should love the unfortunate orphan (boy or girl)
of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child; he should
be as careful and diligent in the management of the orphan&rsquo;s
property as of his own&mdash;or even more careful still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To relieve the poverty of citizens and to preserve the citizen-hood
were objects of public policy and of charity. In Crete and
Sparta the citizens were wholly supported out of the public
resources. In Attica the system was different. The citizens
were aided in various ways, in which, as often happens, legal
or official and voluntary or private methods worked on parallel
lines. The means were (1) legal enactment for release of debts;
(2) emigration; (3) the supply of corn; (4) poor relief for the
infirm, and relief for the children of those fallen in war; (5)
emoluments; (6) voluntary public service, separate gifts and
liberality; (7) loan societies.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) In 594 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the labouring class in Attica were overwhelmed
with debts and mortgages, and their persons pledged as security.
Only by a sharp reform was it possible to preserve them from
slavery. This Solon effected. He annulled their obligations,
abolished the pledge of the person, and gave the labourers the
franchise (but see under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solon</a></span>). Besides the laws above mentioned,
he gave power to the Areopagus to inquire from what sources
each man obtained the necessaries of life, and to punish those who
did not work. His action and that of his successor, Peisistratus
(560 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), suggest that the class of poor (<span class="grk" title="aporoi">&#7940;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>) was increasing,
and that by the efforts of these two men the social decline of the
people was avoided or at least postponed. Peisistratus lent the poor
money that they might maintain themselves in husbandry. He wished,
it is said (Arist. <i>Ath. Pol.</i> xvi.), to enable them to earn a moderate
living, that they might be occupied with their own affairs, instead
of spending their time in the city or neglecting their work in order
to visit it. As rent for their land they paid a tenth of the produce.</p>

<p>(2) Akin to this policy was that of emigration. Athenians, selected
in some instances from the two lowest political classes, emigrated,
though still retaining their rights of citizenship. In 570-565 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Salamis was annexed and divided into lots and settled, and later
Pericles settled more than 2750 citizens in the Chersonese and elsewhere&mdash;practically
a considerable section of the whole body of
citizens. &ldquo;By this means,&rdquo; says Plutarch, &ldquo;he relieved the state
of numerous idle agitators and assisted the necessitous.&rdquo; In other
states this expedient was frequently adopted.</p>

<p>(3)  A third method was the supply of corn at reduced rates&mdash;a
method similar to that adopted, as we shall see, at Rome, Constantinople
and elsewhere. The maintenance of the mass of the people
depended on the corn fleets. There were public granaries, where
large stores were laid up at the public expense. A portion of all
cargoes of corn was retained at Athens and in other ways importation
was promoted. Exportation was forbidden. Public donations
and distributions of corn were frequent, and in times of scarcity rich
citizens made large contributions with that object. The distributions
were made to adult citizens of eighteen years of age and upwards
whose names were on the registers.</p>

<p>(4) In addition to this there was a system of public relief for those
who were unable to earn a livelihood on account of bodily defects
and infirmities. The qualification was a property test. The property
of the applicant had to be shown to be of a value of not more
than three minae (say £12). Socrates, it may be noted, adopts the
same method of estimating his comparative poverty (Xen. <i>Econ.</i> 2.
6), saying that his goods would realize about five minae (or about
twenty guineas). The senate examined the case, and the ecclesia
awarded the bounty, which amounted to 1 or 2 obols a day, rather
more than 1½d. or 3d.&mdash;out-door relief, as we might say, amounting
at most to about 1s. 9d. a week. There was also a fund for the
maintenance of the children of those who had fallen in war, up to the
age of eighteen.</p>

<p>(5)  But the main source of support was the receipt of emoluments
for various public services. This was not relief, though it produced
in the course of time the effect of relief. It was rather the Athenian
method of supporting a governing class of citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page864" id="page864"></a>864</span> </p>

<p>The inner political history of Athens is the history of the extension
of the franchise to the lower classes of citizens, with the privileges
of holding office and receiving emoluments. In early times, either
by Solon (<i>q.v.</i>) or previously, the citizens were classified on the
basis of property. The rich retained the franchise and the right
of holding office; the middle classes obtained the franchise; the
fourth or lowest class gained neither. By the reforms of Cleisthenes
(509 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the clan-family and the phratry were set aside for
the <i>deme</i> or parish, a geographical division superseding the social.
Finally, about 478 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, when all had acquired the franchise, the
right to hold office also was obtained by the third class. These
changes coincided with a period of economic progress. The rate of
interest was high, usually 12%; and in trading and bottomry the
returns were much higher. A small capital at this interest soon
produced comparative wealth; and simultaneously prices were
falling. Then came the reaction. &ldquo;After the Peloponnesian war&rdquo;
(432-404 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), writes Professor Jebb, &ldquo;the wealth of the country
ceased to grow, as population had ceased to grow about 50 years
sooner. The rich went on accumulating: the poor, having no means
of enriching themselves by enterprise, were for the most part occupied
in watching for some chance of snatching a larger share of the
stationary total.&rdquo; Thus the poorer classes in a time of prosperity
had won the power which they were able to turn to their own account
afterwards. A period of economic pressure followed, coupled with a
decline in the population; no return to the land was feasible, nor
was emigration; the people had become town-folk inadaptable to
new uses; decreasing vitality and energy were marked by a new
temper, the &ldquo;pauper&rdquo; temper, unsettled, idle and grasping, and
political power was utilized to obtain relief. The relief was forthcoming,
but it was of no avail to stop the general decline. The state,
it might almost be said, in giving scope to the assertion of the spirit
of dependence, had ruined the self-regarding energy on which both
family and state alike depended. The emoluments were diverse.
The number of citizens was not large; the functions in which citizens
could take part were numerous; and when payment was forthcoming
the poorer citizens pressed in to exercise their rights (cf.
Arist. <i>Pol.</i> 1293 a). All Athenian citizens could attend the public
assembly or <i>ecclesia</i>. Probably the attendance at it varied from
a few hundred to 5000 persons. In 395 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the payment for attendance
was fixed at 3 obols, or little more than 4½d. a day&mdash;for the
system of payment had probably been introduced a few years before
(but see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ecclesia</a></span> and refs.). A juror or <i>dicast</i> would receive
the same sum for attendance, and the courts or juries often consisted
of 500 persons. If the estimate (Böckh, <i>Public Economy of Athens</i>,
Eng. trans. pp. 109, 117) holds good that in the age of Demosthenes
(384-323 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) the member of a poor family of four free persons could
live (including rent) on about 3.3d. or between 2 and 3 obols a day,
the pay of the citizen attending the assembly or the court would at
least cover the expenses of subsistence. On the other hand, it would
be less than the pay of a day labourer, which was probably about
4 obols or 6d. a day. In any case many citizens&mdash;they numbered
in all about 20,000&mdash;in return for their participation in political
duties would receive considerable pecuniary assistance. Attending
a great public festival also, the citizen would receive 2 obols or 3d.
a day during the festival days; and there were besides frequent
public sacrifices, with the meal or feast which accompanied them.
But besides this there were confiscations of private property, which
produced a surplus revenue divisible among the poorer citizens.
(Some hold that there were confiscations in other Greek states, but
not in Athens.) In these circumstances it is not to be wondered
that men like Isocrates should regret that the influence of the
Areopagus, the old court of morals and justice in Athens, had disappeared,
for it &ldquo;maintained a sort of censorial police over the lives
and habits of the citizens; and it professed to enforce a tutelary
and paternal discipline, beyond that which the strict letter of the
law could mark out, over the indolent, the prodigal, the undutiful,
and the deserters of old rite and custom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(6) In addition to public emoluments and relief there was much
private liberality and charity. Many expensive public services
were undertaken honorarily by the citizens under a kind of civic
compulsion. Thus in a trial about 425 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (Lysias, <i>Or.</i> 19. 57) a
citizen submitted evidence that his father expended more than
£2000 during his life in paying the expenses of choruses at festivals,
fitting out seven triremes for the navy, and meeting levies of income
tax to meet emergencies. Besides this he had helped poor citizens
by portioning their daughters and sisters, had ransomed some, and
paid the funeral expenses of others (cf. for other instances Plutarch&rsquo;s
<i>Cimon</i>, Theophrastus, <i>Eth.</i>, and Xen. <i>Econ.</i>).</p>

<p>(7) There were also mutual help societies (<span class="grk" title="eranoi">&#7956;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>). Those for
relief would appear to have been loan societies (cf. Theoph. <i>Eth.</i>),
one of whose members would beat up contributions to help a friend,
who would afterwards repay the advance.</p>

<p>The criticisms of Aristotle (384-321 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) suggest the direction
to which he looked for reform. He (<i>Pol.</i> 1320 a) passes a very
unfavourable judgment on the distribution of public money to the
poorer citizens. The demagogues (he does not speak of Athens
particularly) distributed the surplus revenues to the poor, who
received them all at the same time; and then they were in want
again. It was only, he argued, like pouring water through a sieve.
It were better to see to it that the greater number were not so entirely
destitute, for the depravity of a democratic government was due to
this. The problem was to contrive how plenty (<span class="grk" title="euporia">&#949;&#8016;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>, not poverty,
<span class="grk" title="aporia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>) should become permanent. His proposals are adequate aid
and voluntary charity. Public relief should, he urges, be given in
large amounts so as to help people to acquire small farms or start
in business, and the well-to-do (<span class="grk" title="euporoi">&#949;&#8020;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>) should in the meantime
subscribe to pay the poor for their attendance at the public assemblies.
(This proves, indeed, how the payments had become poor
relief.) He mentions also how the Carthaginian notables divided
the destitute amongst them and gave them the means of setting
to work, and the Tarentines (<span class="grk" title="koina poiountes">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8048; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span>) shared their property
with the poor. (The Rhodians also may be mentioned (Strabo xiv.
c. 652), amongst whom the well-to-do undertook the relief of the
poor voluntarily.) The later word for charitable distribution was
a sharing (<span class="grk" title="koinonia">&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>, Ep. Rom. xv. 26), which would seem to indicate
that after Aristotle&rsquo;s time popular thought had turned in that
direction. But the chief service rendered by Aristotle&mdash;a service
which covered indeed the whole ground of social progress&mdash;was to
show that unless the purpose of civil and social life was carefully
considered and clearly realized by those who desired to improve its
conditions, no change for the better could result from individual
or associated action.</p>
</div>

<p>Two forms of charity have still to be mentioned: charity
to the stranger and to the sick. It will be convenient to consider
both in relation to the whole classical period.</p>

<p>With the growth of towns the administration of hospitality
was elaborated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) There was hospitality between members of families bound
by the rites of host and guest. The guest received as a right only
shelter and fire. Usually he dined with the host the first
day, and if afterwards he was fed provisions were supplied
<span class="sidenote">The stranger.</span>
to him. There were large guest-chambers (<span class="grk" title="xenon">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>) or small
guest-houses, completely isolated on the right or left of the principal
house; and here the guest was lodged. (2) There were also, <i>e.g.</i> at
Hierapolis (Sir W.M. Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Phrygia</i>, ii. 97), brotherhoods
of hospitality (<span class="grk" title="xenoi tekmêreioi">&#958;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#949;&#954;&#956;&#951;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span>, bearers of the sign), which made
hospitality a duty, and had a common chest and Apollo as their
tutelary god. (3) There were inns or resting-places (<span class="grk" title="katagogia">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#974;&#947;&#953;&#945;</span>)
for strangers at temples (Thuc. iii. 68; Plato, <i>Laws</i>, 953 A) and
places of resort (<span class="grk" title="lesche">&#955;&#941;&#963;&#967;&#951;</span>) at or near the temples for the entertainment
of strangers&mdash;for instance, at a temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus
(Pausanias ii. 174); and Pausanias argues that they were
common throughout the country. Probably also at the temples
hospitable provision was made for strangers. The evidence at
present is not perhaps sufficiently complete, but, so far as it goes,
it tends to the conclusion that in pre-Christian times hospitality
was provided to passers-by and strangers in the temple buildings,
as later it was furnished in the monasteries and churches. (4) There
were also in towns houses for strangers (<span class="grk" title="xenon">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>) provided at the
public cost. This was so at Megara; and in Crete strangers had a
place at the public meals and a dormitory. Xenophon suggested
that it would be profitable for the Athenian state to establish inns
for traders (<span class="grk" title="katagogia dêmusia">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#974;&#947;&#953;&#945; &#948;&#951;&#956;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#945;</span>) at Athens. Thus, apart from the
official hospitality of the proxenus or &ldquo;consul,&rdquo; who had charge of
the affairs of foreigners, and the hospitality which was shown to
persons of distinction by states or private individuals, there was in
Greece a large provision for strangers, wayfarers and vagrants based
on the charitable sentiment of hospitality. Among the Romans
similar customs of private and public hospitality prevailed; and
throughout the empire the older system was altered, probably very
slowly. In Christian times (cf. Ramsay above) Pagan temples were
(about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 408) utilized for other purposes, including that of hospitality
to strangers.</p>
</div>

<p>Round the temples, at first probably village temples, the
organization of medical relief grew up. Primitive medicine is
connected with dreams, worship, and liturgical
&ldquo;pollution,&rdquo; punishment and penitence, and an
<span class="sidenote">The sick.</span>
experimental practice. Finally, systematic observation and
science (with no knowledge of chemistry and little of physiology)
assert themselves, and a secular administration is created by
the side of the older religious organization.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Sickness among primitive races is conceived to be a material
substance to be extracted, or an evil spirit to be driven away by
incantation. Religion and medicine are thus at the beginning
almost one and the same thing. In Anatolia, in the groups of
villages (cf. Ramsay as above, i. 101) under the theocratic government
of a central <span class="grk" title="ieron">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;</span> or temple, the god Men Karou was the
physician and saviour (<span class="grk" title="soter">&#963;&#969;&#964;&#942;&#961;</span> and <span class="grk" title="sozon">&#963;&#974;&#950;&#969;&#957;</span>) of his people.
Priests, prophets and physicians were his ministers. He punished wrong-doing
by diseases which he taught the penitent to cure. So elsewhere
pollution, physical or moral, was chastened by disease and
loss of property or children, and further ills were avoided by sacrifice
and expiation and public warning. In the temple and out of this
phase of thought grew up schools of medicine, in whose practice
dreams and religious ritual retained a place. The newer gods,
Asclepius and Apollo, succeeded the older local divinities; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page865" id="page865"></a>865</span>
the &ldquo;sons&rdquo; of Asclepius became a profession, and the temple with
its adjacent buildings a kind of hospital. There were many temples
of Asclepius in Greece and elsewhere, placed generally in high and
salubrious positions. After ablution the patient offered sacrifices,
repeating himself the words of the hymn that was chanted. Then,
when night came on, he slept in the temple. In the early dawn he
was to dream &ldquo;the heavenly dream&rdquo; which would suggest his cure;
but if he did not dream, relations and others&mdash;officials at the
temple&mdash;might dream for him. At dawn the priests or sons of Asclepius
came into the temple and visited the sick, so that, in a kind of
drama, where reality and appearance seemed to meet, the patients
believed that they saw the god himself. The next morning the
prescription and treatment were settled. At hand in the inn or
guest-chambers of the temple the patient could remain, sleeping
again in the temple, if necessary, and carrying out the required
regimen. In the temple were votive tablets of cases, popular and
awe-inspiring, and records and prescriptions, which later found
their way into the medical works of Galen and others. At the
temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus was an inn (<span class="grk" title="katagogion">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#974;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) with
four courts and colonnades, and in all 160 rooms. (Cf. Pausanias
ii. 171; and <i>Report, Archaeol. in Greece</i>, R.C. Bosanquet, 1899,
1900.)</p>
</div>

<p>At three centres more particularly, Rhodes, Cnidos and Cos,
were the medical schools of the Asclepiads. If one may judge
from an inscription at Athens, priests of Asclepius attended the
poor gratuitously. And years afterwards, in the 11th century,
when there was a revival of medicine, we find (Daremberg, <i>La
Médecine: histoire et doctrines</i>) at Salerno the Christian priest as
doctor, a simple and less palatable pharmacy for the poor than
for the rich, and gratuitous medical relief.</p>

<p>Besides the temple schools and hospitals there was a secular
organization of medical aid and relief. States appointed trained
medical men as physicians, and provided for them medical
establishments (<span class="grk" title="iatreia">&#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>, &ldquo;large houses with large doors full of
light&rdquo;) for the reception of the sick, and for operations there
were provided beds, instruments, medicines, &amp;c. At these places
also pupils were taught. A lower degree of medical establishment
was to be found at the barbers&rsquo; shops. Out-patients were seen
at the <i>iatreia</i>. They were also visited at home. There were
doctors&rsquo; assistants and slave doctors. The latter, apparently,
attended only slaves (Plato, <i>Laws</i>, 720); they do &ldquo;a great
service to the master of the house, who in this manner is relieved
of the care of his slaves.&rdquo; It was a precept of Hippocrates that
if a physician came to a town where there were sick poor, he
should make it his first duty to attend to them; and the state
physician attended gratuitously any one who applied to him.
There were also travelling physicians going rounds to heal
children and the poor. These methods continued, probably all
of them, to Christian times.</p>

<p>It has been argued that medical practice was introduced into
Italy by the Greeks. But the evidence seems to show that there
was a quite independent Latin tradition and school of medicine
(René Brian, &ldquo;Médecine dans le Latium et à Rome,&rdquo; <i>Rev.
Archéol.</i>, 1885). In Rome there were consulting-rooms and
dispensaries, and houses in which the sick were received.
Hospitals are mentioned by Roman writers in the 1st century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> There were infirmaries&mdash;detached buildings&mdash;for sick
slaves; and in Rome, as at Athens, there were slaves skilled in
medicine. In Rome also for each <i>regio</i> there was a chief physician
who attended to the poorer people.</p>

<p>Slavery was so large a factor in pre-Christian and early
Christian society that a word should be said on its relation
to charity. Indirectly it was a cause of poverty
and social degradation. Thus in the case of Athens,
<span class="sidenote">Slavery.</span>
with the achievement of maritime supremacy the number of
slaves increased greatly. Manual arts were despised as unbecoming
to a citizen, and the slaves carried on the larger part
of the agricultural and industrial work of the community; and
for a time&mdash;until after the Peloponnesian War (404 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)&mdash;slavery
was an economic success. But by degrees the slave, it
would seem, dispossessed the citizen and rendered him unfit
for competition. The position of the free artisan thus became
akin to that of the slave (Arist. <i>Pol.</i> 1260 a, &amp;c.), and slavery
became the industrial method of the country. Though Greeks,
Romans, Jews and Christians spent money in ransoming
individual slaves and also enfranchised many, no general abolition
of slavery was possible. At last through economic changes the
new status of <i>coloni</i>, who paid as rent part of the produce of the
land they tilled, superseded the status of slavery (cf. above;
the system turned to account by Peisistratus). But this result
was only achieved much later, when a new society was being
created, when the slaves from the slave prisons (<i>ergastula</i>) of
Italy joined its invaders, and the slave-owner or master, as one
may suppose, unable any longer to work the gangs, let them
become <i>coloni</i>.</p>

<p>In Greece the feeling towards the slave became constantly
more humane. Real slavery, Aristotle said, was a cast of mind,
not a condition of life. The slave was not to be ordered about,
but to be commanded and persuaded like a child. The master
was under the strongest obligation to promote his welfare. In
Rome, on the other hand, slavery continued to the end a massive,
brutal, industrial force&mdash;a standing danger to the state. But
alike in Greece and Rome the influence of slavery on the family
was pernicious. The pompous array of domestic slaves, the
transfer of motherly duties to slave nurses, the loss of that
homely education which for most people comes only from the
practical details of life&mdash;all this in later Greece and Italy, and
far into Christian times, prevented that permanent invigoration
and reform of family life which Jewish and Christian influences
might otherwise have produced.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part III.&mdash;Charity in Roman Times</p>

<p>The words that suggest most clearly the Roman attitude
towards what we call charity are <i>liberalitas</i>, <i>beneficentia</i> and
<i>pietas</i>. The two former are almost synonymous (Cicero, <i>De
Offic.</i> i. 7, 14). Liberality lays stress on the mood&mdash;that of the
<i>liber</i>, the freeborn, and so in a sense the independent and superior;
beneficence on the deed and its purpose (Seneca, <i>De Benef.</i> vi. 10).
The conditions laid down by Cicero, following Panaetius the Stoic
(185-112 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) are three: not to do harm to him whom one would
benefit, not to exceed one&rsquo;s means, and to have regard to merit.
The character of the person whom we would benefit should be
considered, his feelings towards us, the interest of the community,
our social relations in life, and services rendered in the past.
The utility of the deed or gift graded according to social relationship
and estimated largely from the point of view of ultimate
advantage to the doer or donor seems to predominate in the
general thought of the book, though (cf. Aristotle, <i>Eth.</i> viii. 3)
the idea culminates in the completeness of friendship where &ldquo;all
things are in common.&rdquo; <i>Pietas</i> has the religious note which the
other words lack, loving dutifulness to gods and home and
country. Not &ldquo;piety&rdquo; only but &ldquo;pity&rdquo; derive from it: thus
it comes near to our &ldquo;charity.&rdquo; Both books, the <i>De Officiis</i>
and the <i>De Beneficiis</i>, represent a Roman and Stoical revision
of the problem of charity and, as in Stoicism generally, there
seems to be a half-conscious attempt to feel the way to a new
social standpoint from this side.</p>

<p>As from the point of view of charity the well-being of the
community depends upon the vigour of the deep-laid elemental
life within it, so in passing to Roman times we consider
the family first. The Roman family was unique in its
<span class="sidenote">Roman times.</span>
completeness, and by some of its conditions the world
has long been bound. The father alone had independent authority
(<i>sui juris</i>), and so long as he lived all who were under his power&mdash;his
wife, his sons, and their wives and children, and his unmarried
daughters&mdash;could not acquire any property of their own. Failing
father or husband, the unmarried daughters were placed under
the guardianship of the nearest male members of the family.
Thus the family, in the narrower sense in which we commonly
use the word, as meaning descendants of a common father or
grandfather, was, as it were, a single point of growth in a larger
organism, the <i>gens</i>, which consisted of all those who shared a
common ancestry.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The wife, though in law the property of her husband, held a
position of honour and influence higher than that of the Greek
wife, at least in historic times. She seems to come nearer to the
ideal of Xenophon: &ldquo;the good wife should be the mistress of everything
within the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;A house of his own and the blessing
of children appeared to the Roman citizen as the end and essence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page866" id="page866"></a>866</span>
of life&rdquo; (Mommsen, <i>Hist. Rome</i>). The obligation of the father to
the sons was strongly felt. The family, past, present and future,
was conceived as one and indivisible. Each succeeding generation
had a right to the care of its predecessor in mind, body and estate.
The training of the sons was distinctly a home and not a school
training. Brought up by the father and constantly at his side, they
learnt spontaneously the habits and traditions of the family. The
home was their school. By their father they were introduced into
public life, and though still remaining under his power during his
lifetime, they became citizens, and their relation to the state was
direct. The nation was a nation of yeomen. Only agriculture and
warfare were considered honourable employments. The father and
sons worked outdoors on the farm, employing little or no slave
labour; the wife and daughters indoors at spinning and weaving.
The drudgery of the household was done by domestic slaves. The
father was the working head of a toiling household. Their chief
gods were the same as those of early Greece&mdash;Zeus-Diovis and
Hestia-Vesta, the goddess of the hearth and home. Out of this
solid, compact family Roman society was built, and so long as the
family was strong attachment to the service of the state was intense.
The <i>res publica</i>, the common weal, the phrase and the thought, meet
one at every turn; and never were citizens more patient and
tenacious combatants on their country&rsquo;s behalf. The men were
soldiers in an unpaid militia and were constantly engaged in wars
with the rivals of Rome, leaving home and family for their campaigns
and returning to them in the winter. With a hardness and
closeness inconsistent with&mdash;indeed, opposed to&mdash;the charitable
spirit, they combined the strength of character and sense of justice
without which charity becomes sentimental and unsocial. In the
development of the family, and thus, indirectly, in the development
of charity, they stand for settled obligation and unrelenting duty.</p>
</div>

<p>Under the protection of the head of the family &ldquo;in dependent
freedom&rdquo; lived the clients. They were in a middle position
between the freemen and the slaves. The relation between
patron and client lasted for several generations; and there were
many clients. Their number increased as state after state was
conquered, and they formed the <i>plebs</i>, in Rome the <i>plebs urbana</i>,
the lower orders of the city.</p>

<p>In relation to our subject the important factors are the family,
the <i>plebs</i> and slavery.</p>

<p>Two processes were at work from an early date, before the first
agrarian law (486 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>): the impoverishment of the <i>plebs</i> and
the increase of slavery. The former led to the <i>annona civica</i>, or
the free supply of corn to the citizens, and to the <i>sportula</i> or the
organized food-supply for poor clients, and ultimately to the
<i>alimentarii pueri</i>, the maintenance of children of citizens by
voluntary and imperial bounty. The latter (slavery) was the
standing witness that, as self-support was undermined, the task
of relief became hopeless, and the impoverished citizen, as the
generations passed, became in turn dependant, beggar, pauper
and slave.</p>

<p>The great patrician families&mdash;&ldquo;an oligarchy of warriors and
slaveholders&rdquo;&mdash;did not themselves engage in trade, but, entering
on large speculations, employed as their agents their clients,
<i>libertini</i> or freedmen, and, later, their slaves. The constant
wars, for which the soldiers of a local militia were eventually
retained in permanent service, broke up the yeomanry and very
greatly reduced their number. Whole families of citizens became
impoverished, and their lands were in consequence sold to
the large patrician families, members of which had acquired
lucrative posts, or prospered in their speculations, and assumed
possession of the larger part of the land, the <i>ager publicus</i>,
acquired by the state through conquest. The city had always
been the centre of the patrician families, the patron of the trading
<i>libertini</i> and other dependants. To it now flocked as well the
<i>metoeci</i>, the resident aliens from the conquered states, and the
poorer citizens, landless and unable for social reasons to turn to
trade. There was thus in Rome a growing multitude of aliens,
dispossessed yeomen and dependent clients. Simultaneously
slavery increased very largely after the second Punic War
(202 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Every conquest brought slaves into the market, for
whom ready purchasers were found. The slaves took the place
of the freemen upon the old family estates, and the free country
people became extinct. Husbandry gave place to shepherding.
The estates were thrown into large domains (<i>latifundia</i>), managed
by bailiffs and worked by slaves, often fettered or bound by
chains, lodged in cells in houses of labour (<i>ergastula</i>), and sometimes
cared for when ill in infirmaries (<i>valetudinaria</i>). In Crete
and Sparta the slaves toiled that the mass of citizens might have
means and leisure. In Rome the slave class was organized for
private and not for common ends. In Athens the citizens were
paid for their services; at Rome no offices were paid. Thus
the citizen at Rome was, one might almost say, forced into a
dependence on the public corn, for as the large properties
swallowed up the smaller, and the slave dispossessed the citizen,
a population grew up unfit for rural toil, disinclined to live by
methods that pride considered sordid, unstable and pleasure-loving,
and yet a serious political factor, as dependent on the
rich for their enjoyments as they were on their patrons or the
prefect of the corn in the city for their food.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is estimated, from extremely difficult and uncertain data, that
the population of Rome in the time of Augustus was about 1,200,000
or 1,500,000. At that time the<i> plebs urbana</i> numbered 320,000. If
this be multiplied by three, to give a low average of dependants,
wives and children, this section of the population would number
960,000. The remainder of the 1,500,000, 540,000, would consist of
(a) slaves, and (b) those, the comparatively few, who would be
members of the great clan-families (<i>gentes</i>). Proportionately to
Attica this seems to allow too small a population of slaves. But
however this be, we may picture the population of Rome as consisting
chiefly of a few patrician families ministered to by a very large
number of slaves, and a populace of needy citizens, in whose ranks it
was profitable for an outsider to find a place in order that he might
participate in the advantages of state maintenance.</p>
</div>

<p>In Rome the clan-family became the dominant political factor.
As in England and elsewhere in the middle ages, and even in
later times, the family, in these circumstances, assumes
an influence which is out of harmony with the common
<span class="sidenote">The annona civica.</span>
good. The social advantage of the family lies in its
self-maintenance, its home charities, and its moral
and educational force, but if its separate interests are made
supreme, it becomes uncharitable and unsocial. In Rome this
was the line of development. The stronger clan-families crushed
the weaker, and became the &ldquo;oligarchy of warriors and slaveholders.&rdquo;
In the same spirit they possessed themselves of
the <i>ager publicus</i>. The land obtained by the Romans by right
of conquest was public. It belonged to the state, and to a yeoman
state it was the most valuable acquisition. At first part of
it was sold and part was distributed to citizens without property
and destitute (cf. Plutarch, <i>Tib. Gracchus</i>). At a very early date,
however, the patrician families acquired possession of much of
it and held it at a low rental, and thus the natural outlet for a
conquering farmer race was monopolized by one class, the richer
clan-families. This injustice was in part remedied by the
establishment of colonies, in which the emigrant citizens received
sufficient portions of land. But these colonies were comparatively
few, and after each conquest the rich families made large purchases,
while the smaller proprietors, whose services as soldiers
were constantly required, were unable to attend to their lands
or to retain possession of them. To prevent this (367 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
the Licinian law was passed, by which ownership in land was
limited to 500 <i>jugera</i>, about 312 acres. This law was ignored,
however, and more than two centuries later the evil, the double
evil of the dispossession of the citizen farmer and of slavery,
reached a crisis. The slave war broke out (134 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and (133 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
Tiberius Gracchus made his attempt to re-endow the Roman
citizens with the lands which they had acquired by conquest.
He undertook what was essentially a charitable or philanthropic
movement, which was set on foot too late. He had passed through
Tuscany, and seen with resentment and pity the deserted
country where the foreign slaves and barbarians were now
the only shepherds and cultivators. He had been brought up
under the influence of Greek Stoical thought, with which, almost
in spite of itself, there was always associated an element of pity.
The problem which he desired to solve, though larger in scale,
was essentially the same as that with which Solon and Peisistratus
had dealt successfully. At bottom the issue lay between
private property, considered as the basis of family life for the
great bulk of the community, with personal independence, and
pauperism, with the <i>annona</i> or slavery. In 133 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Tiberius
Gracchus became tribune. To expand society on the lines of
private property, he proposed the enforcement of &ldquo;the Licinian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page867" id="page867"></a>867</span>
Rogations&rdquo;; the rich were to give up all beyond their rightful
312 acres, and the remainder was to be distributed amongst
the poor. The measure was carried by the use of arbitrary
powers, and followed by the death of Tiberius at the hands of
the patricians, the dominant clan-families. In 132 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Caius
Gracchus took up his brother&rsquo;s quarrel, and adopting, it would
seem, a large scheme of political and social reform, proposed
measures for emigration and for relief. The former failed; the
latter apparently were acceptable to all parties, and continued
in force long after C. Gracchus had been slain (121 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). Already,
at times, there had been sales of corn at cheap prices. Now, by
the <i>lex frumentaria</i> he gave the citizens&mdash;those who had the
Roman franchise&mdash;the right to purchase corn every month from
the public stores at rather more than half-price, 6<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> <i>asses</i> or about
3.3d. the peck. This, the fatal alternative, was accepted, and
henceforth there was no possibility of a reversion to better social
conditions.</p>

<p>The provisioning of Rome was, like that of Athens, a public
service. There were public granaries (267 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and there was
a quaestor to supervise the transit of the corn from Sicily and,
later, from Spain and Africa, and an elaborate administration
for collecting and conveying it. The <i>lex frumentaria</i> of Caius was
followed by the <i>lex Octavia</i>, restricting the monthly sale to citizens
settled in Rome, and to 5 <i>modii</i> (1¼ bushels). According to
Polybius, the amount required for the maintenance of a slave
was 5 <i>modii</i> a month, and of a soldier 4. Hence the allowance,
if continued at this rate, was practically a maintenance. The
<i>lex Clodia</i> (58 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) made the corn gratuitous to the <i>plebs
urbana</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Julius Caesar (5 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) found the number of recipients to be 320,000,
and reduced them to 150,000. In Augustus&rsquo;s time they rose to
200,000. There seems, however, to be some confusion as to the
numbers. From the <i>Ancyranum Monumentum</i> it appears that the
<i>plebs urbana</i> who received Augustus&rsquo;s dole of 60 <i>denarii</i> (37s. 6d.)
in his eighth consulship numbered 320,000. And (Suet. <i>Caes.</i> 41)
it seems likely that in Caesar&rsquo;s time the lists of the recipients were
settled by lot; further, probably only those whose property was
worth less than 400,000 <i>sesterces</i> (£3541) were placed on the lists.
It is probable, therefore, that 320,000 represents a maximum,
reduced for purposes of administration to a smaller number (a) by
a property test, and (b) by some kind of scrutiny. The names of
those certified to receive the corn were exposed on bronze tablets.
They were then called <i>aerarii</i>. They had tickets (<i>tesserae</i>) for
purposes of identification, and they received the corn or bread in the
time of the republic at the temple of Ceres, and afterwards at steps
in the several (14) regions or wards of Rome. Hence the bread was
called <i>panis gradilis</i>. In the middle of the 2nd century there were
state bakeries, and wheaten loaves were baked for the people perhaps
two or three times a week. In Aurelian&rsquo;s time (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 270) the flour
was of the best, and the weight of the loaf (one <i>uncia</i>) was doubled.
To the gifts of bread were added pork, oil and possibly wine;
clothes also&mdash;white tunics with long sleeves&mdash;were distributed.
In the period after Constantine (cf. <i>Theod. Code</i>, xiv. 15) three
classes received the bread&mdash;the palace people (<i>palatini</i>), soldiers
(<i>militares</i>), and the populace (<i>populares</i>). No distribution was
permitted except at the steps. Each class had its own steps in the
several wards. The bread at one step could not be transferred to
another step. Each class had its own supply. There were arrangements
for the exchange of stale loaves. Against misappropriation
there were (law of Valentinian and Valens) severe penalties. If a public
prosecutor (<i>actor</i>), a collector of the revenue (<i>procurator</i>), or
the slave of a senator obtained bread with the cognizance of the
clerk, or by bribery, the slave, if his master was not a party to the
offence, had to serve in the state bakehouse in chains. If the master
were involved, his house was confiscated. If others who had not the
right obtained the bread, they and their property were placed at
the service of the bakery (<i>pistrini exercitio subjugari</i>). If they were
poor (<i>pauperes</i>) they were enslaved, and the delinquent client was
to be put to death.</p>
</div>

<p>The right to relief was dependent on the right of citizenship.
Hence it became hereditary and passed from father to son.
It was thus in the nature of a continuous endowed charity, like the
well-known family charity of Smith, for instance, in which a
large property was left to the testator&rsquo;s descendants, of whom
it was said that as a result no Smith of that family could fail to be
poor. But the <i>annona civica</i> was an endowed charity, affecting
not a single family, but the whole population. Later, when
Constantinople was founded, the right to relief was attached to
new houses as a premium on building operations. Thus it
belonged not to persons only, but also to houses, and became a
species of &ldquo;immovable&rdquo; property, passing to the purchaser of
the house or property, as would the adscript slaves. The bread
followed the house (<i>aedes sequantur annonae</i>). If, on the transfer
of a house, bread claims were lost owing to the absence of
claimants, they were transferred to the treasury (<i>fisci viribus
vindicentur</i>). But the savage law of Valentinian, referred to
above, shows to what lengths such a system was pushed. Early
in its history the <i>annona civica</i> attracted many to Rome in the
hope of living there without working. For the 400 years since
the <i>lex Clodia</i> was enacted constant injury had been done by it,
and now (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 364) people had to be kept off the civic bounty as
if they were birds of prey, and the very poor man (<i>pauperrimus</i>),
who had no civic title to the food, if he obtained it by fraud,
was enslaved. Thus, in spite of the abundant state relief, there
had grown up a class of the very poor, the Gentiles of the state,
who were outside the sphere of its ministrations. The <i>annona
civica</i> was introduced not only into Constantinople, but also
into Alexandria, with baleful results, and into Antioch. When
Constantinople was founded the corn-ships of Africa sailed there
instead of to Rome. On charitable relief, as we shall see, the
<i>annona</i> has had a long-continued and fatal influence.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. If the government considers itself responsible for provisioning
the people it must fix the price of necessaries, and to meet distress
or popular clamour it will lower the price. It becomes thus a large
relief society for the supply of corn. In a time of distress, when the
corn laws were a matter of moment in England, a similar system was
adopted in the well-known Speenhamland scale (1795), by which a
larger or lesser allowance was given to a family according to its size
and the prevailing price of corn. A maintenance was thus provided
for the able-bodied and their families, at least in part, without any
equivalent in labour; though in England labour was demanded of
the applicant, and work was done more or less perfunctorily. In
amount the Roman dole seems to have been equivalent to the
allowance provided for a slave, but the citizen received it without
having to do any labour task. He received it as a statutory right.
There could hardly be a more effective method for degrading his
manhood and denaturalizing his family. He was also a voter, and
the alms appealed to his weakness and indolence; and the fear of
displeasing him and losing his vote kept him, socially, master of the
situation, to his own ruin. If in England now relief were given to
able-bodied persons who retained their votes, this evil would also
attach to it.</p>

<p>2. The system obliged the hard-working to maintain the idlers,
while it continually increased their number. The needy teacher
in Juvenal, instead of a fee, is put off with a <i>tessera</i>, to which, not
being a citizen, he has no right. &ldquo;The foreign reapers,&rdquo; it was said,
&ldquo;filled Rome&rsquo;s belly and left Rome free for the stage and the circus.&rdquo;
The freeman had become a slave&mdash;&ldquo;stupid and drowsy, to whom
days of ease had become habitual, the games, the circus, the theatre,
dice, eating-houses and brothels.&rdquo; Here are all the marks of a
degraded pauperism.</p>

<p>3. The system led the way to an ever more extensive slavery.
The man who could not live on his dole and other scrapings had the
alternative of becoming a slave. &ldquo;Better have a good master than
live so distressfully&rdquo;; and &ldquo;If I were free I should live at my own
risk; now I live at yours,&rdquo; are the expressions suggestive of the
natural temptations of slavery in these conditions. The escaped
slaves returned to &ldquo;their manger.&rdquo; The <i>annona</i> did not prevent
destitution. It was a half-way house to slavery.</p>

<p>4. The effect on agriculture, and proportionally on commerce
generally, was ruinous. The largest corn-market, Rome, was withdrawn
from the trade&mdash;the market to which all the necessaries of
life would naturally have gravitated; and the supply of corn was
placed in the hands of producers at a few centres where it could be
grown most cheaply&mdash;Sicily, Spain and Africa. The Italian farmer
had to turn his attention to other produce&mdash;the cultivation of the
olive and the vine, and cattle and pig rearing. The greater the
extension of the system the more impossible was the regeneration of
Rome. The Roman citizen might well say that he was out of
work, for, so far as the land was concerned, the means of obtaining
a living were placed out of his reach. While not yet unfitted for
the country by life in the town, he at least could not &ldquo;return to the land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>5. The method was the outcome of distress and political hopelessness.
Yet the rich also adopted it in distributing their private
largess. Cicero (<i>De Off.</i> ii. 16) writes as though he recognized its
evil; but though he expresses his disapprobation of the popular
shows upon which the <i>aediles</i> spent large sums, he argues that
something must be done &ldquo;if the people demand it, and if good men,
though they do not wish it, assent to it.&rdquo; Thus in a guarded manner
he approves a distribution of food&mdash;a free breakfast in the streets
of Rome. One bad result of the <i>annona</i> was that it encouraged a
special and ruinous form of charitable munificence.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page868" id="page868"></a>868</span> </p>

<p>The <i>sportula</i> was a form of charity corresponding to the <i>annona
civica</i>. Charity and poor relief run on parallel lines, and when
the one is administered without discrimination, little
discrimination will usually be exercised in the other.
<span class="sidenote">The sportula.</span>
It was the charity of the patron of the chiefs of the
clan-families to their clients. Between them it was natural that
a relation, partly hospitable, partly charitable, should grow up.
The clients who attended the patron at his house were invited
to dine at his table. The patron, as Juvenal describes him,
dined luxuriously and in solitary grandeur, while the guests put
up with what they could get; or, as was usual under the empire,
instead of the dinner (<i>coena recta</i>) a present of food was given at
the outer vestibule of the house to clients who brought with them
baskets (<i>sportula</i>) to carry off their food, or even charcoal stoves
to keep it warm. There was endless trickery. The patron (or
almoner who acted for him) tried to identify the applicant,
fearing lest he might get the dole under a false name; and at each
mansion was kept a list of persons, male and female, entitled to
receive the allowance. &ldquo;The pilferer grabs the dole&rdquo; (<i>sportulam
furunculus captat</i>) was a proverb. The <i>sportula</i> was a charity
sufficiently important for state regulation. Nero (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 54)
reduced it to a payment in money (100 <i>quadrantes</i>, about 1s.).
Domitian (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 81) restored the custom of giving food. Subsequently
both practices&mdash;gifts in money and in food&mdash;appear to have been continued.</p>

<p>In these conditions the Roman family steadily decayed. Its
&ldquo;old discipline&rdquo; was neglected; and Tacitus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 75), in his
dialogue on Oratory, wrote (c. xxviii.) what might be called its
epitaph. Of the general decline the laws of Caesar and Augustus
to encourage marriage and to reward the parents of large families
are sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>The destruction of the working-class family must have been
finally achieved by the imperial control of the <i>collegia</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In old Rome there were corporations of craftsmen for common
worship, and for the maintenance of the traditions of the craft.
These corporations were ruined by slave labour, and
becoming secret societies, in the time of Augustus were
<span class="sidenote">The collegia.</span>
suppressed. Subsequently they were reorganized, and
gave scope for much friendliness. They often existed in connexion
with some great house, whose chief was their patron and whose
household gods they worshipped. The gilds of the poor, or rather
of the lower orders (<i>collegia tenuiorum</i>), consisted of artisans and
others, and slaves also, who paid monthly contributions to a common
fund to meet the expenses of worship, common meals, and funerals.
They were not in Italy, it would seem (J.P. Waltzing, <i>Études histor.
sur les corporations professionnelles chez les Romains</i>, i. 145, 300),
though they may have been in Asia Minor and elsewhere, societies
for mutual help generally. They were chiefly funeral benefit societies.
Under Severus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 192) the <i>collegia</i> were extended and more
closely organized as industrial bodies. They were protected and
controlled, as in England in the 15th century the municipalities
affected the cause of the craft gilds and ended by controlling them.
Industrial disorder was thus prevented; the government were able
to provide the supplies required in Rome and the large cities with
less risk and uncertainty; and the workmen employed in trade,
especially the carrying trade, became almost slaves. In the 2nd
century, and until the invasions, there were three groups of <i>collegia</i>:
(1) those engaged in various state manufactures; (2) those engaged
in the provision trade; and (3) the free trades, which gradually
lapsed into a kind of slavery. If the members of these gilds fled they
were brought back by force. Parents had to keep to the trade to
which they belonged; their children had to succeed them in it.
A slave caste indeed had been formed of the once free workmen.</p>
</div>

<p>As a charitable protest against the destruction of children,
in the midst of a broken family life, and increasing dependence
and poverty, a special institution was founded (to use
<span class="sidenote">Pueri alimentarii.</span>
the Scottish word) for the &ldquo;alimentation&rdquo; of the
children of citizens, at first by voluntary charity and
afterwards by imperial bounty.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Nerva and Trajan adopted the plan. Pliny (<i>Ep.</i> vii. 18) refers
to it. There was a desire to give more lasting and certain help
than an allotment of food to parents. A list of children, whose
names were on the relief tables at Rome, was accordingly drawn
up, and a special service for their maintenance established. Two
instances are recorded in inscriptions&mdash;one at Veleia, one at Beneventum.
The emperor lent money for the purpose at a low percentage&mdash;2½
or 5% as against the usual 10 or 12. At Veleia his loan
amounted to 1,044,000 <i>sesterces</i>&mdash;about £8156, and 51 of the local
landed proprietors mortgaged land, valued at 13 or 14 million
<i>sesterces</i>, as security for the debt. The interest on the emperor&rsquo;s
money at 5% was paid into the municipal treasury, and out of it the
children were relieved. The figures seem small; at Veleia 300
children were assisted, of whom 36 were girls. The annual interest
at 5% amounted to nearly £408, which divided among 300 gives
about 27s. a head. The figures suggest that the money served as a
charitable supplementation of the citizens&rsquo; relief in direct aid of
the children. Apparently the scheme was widely adopted. Curators
of high position were the patrons; procurators acted as inspectors
over large areas; and <i>quaestores alimentarii</i> undertook the local
management. Antoninus Pius (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 138), and Marcus Aurelius
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 160), and subsequently Severus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 192) established these
bursaries for children in the names of their wives. In the 3rd century
the system fell into disorder. There were large arrears of payments,
and in the military anarchy that ensued it came to an end. It is of
special interest, as indicating a new feeling of responsibility towards
children akin to the humane Stoicism of the Antonines, and an
attempt to found, apart from temples or <i>collegia</i>, what was in the
nature of a public endowed charity.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part IV.&mdash;Jewish and Christian Charity</p>

<p>With Christianity two elements came into fusion, the Jewish
and the Greco-Roman. To trace this fusion and its results it is
necessary to describe the Jewish system of charity, and to compare
it with that of the early Christian church, to note the theory
of love or friendship in Aristotle as representing Greek thought,
and of charity in St Paul as representing Christian thought, and
to mark the Roman influences which moulded the administration
of Ambrose and Gregory and Western Christianity generally.</p>

<p>In the early history of the Hebrews we find the family,
clan-family and tribe. With the Exodus (probably about 1390 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
comes the law of Moses (cf. Kittel, <i>Hist. of the Hebrews</i>,
Eng. trans. i. 244), the central and permanent element
<span class="sidenote">Hebrew charity.</span>
of Jewish thought. We may compare it to the
&ldquo;commandments&rdquo; of Hesiod. There is the recognition of the
family and its obligations: &ldquo;Honour thy father and mother&rdquo;;
and honour included help and support. There is also the law
essential to family unity: &ldquo;Thou shalt not commit adultery&rdquo;;
and as to property there is imposed the regulation of desire:
&ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Maimonides
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1135), true to the old conception of the family (x. 16), calls
the support of adult children, &ldquo;after one is exempt from supporting
them,&rdquo; and the support of a father or mother by a child,
&ldquo;great acts of charity; since kindred are entitled to the first
consideration.&rdquo; To relief of the stranger the Decalogue makes no
reference, but in the Hebraic laws it is constantly pressed; and
the Levitical law (xix. 18) goes further. It first applies a new
standard to social life: &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;
This thought is the outcome of a deep ethical fervour&mdash;the
element which the Jews brought into the work of charity.
In Judges and Joshua, the &ldquo;Homeric&rdquo; books of the Old Testament,
the Hebrews appear as a passionately fierce and cruel
people. Subsequently against their oppression of the poor the
prophets protested with a vehemence as great as the evil was
intense; and their denunciations remained part of the national
literature, a standing argument that life without charity is
nothing worth. Thus schooled and afterwards tutored into
discipline by the tribulation of the exile (587 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), they turned
their fierceness into a zeal, which, as their literature shows, was
as fervent in ethics as it was in religion and ceremonial. In the
services at the synagogues, which supplemented and afterwards
took the place of the Temple, the Commandments were constantly
repeated and the Law and the Prophets read; and as the Jews
of the Dispersion increased in number, and especially after the
destruction of Jerusalem, the synagogues became centres of social
and charitable co-operation. Thus rightly would a Jewish rabbi
say, &ldquo;On three things the world is stayed: on the Thorah (or
the law), and on worship, and on the bestowal of kindness.&rdquo;
Also there was on the charitable side an indefinite power of
expansion. Rigid in its ceremonial, there it was free. Within
the nation, as the Prophets, and after the exile, as the Psalms
show, there was the hope of a universal religion, and with it of a
universally recognized charity. St Paul accentuated the prohibitive
side of the law and protested against it; but, even while
he was so doing, stimulated by the Jewish discipline, he was
moving unfettered towards new conceptions of charity and life&mdash;charity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page869" id="page869"></a>869</span>
as the central word of the Christian life, and life as a
participation in a higher existence&mdash;the &ldquo;body of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To mark the line of development, we could compare&mdash;1. The
family among the Jews and in the early Christian church;
2. The sources of relief and the tithe, the treatment of the poor
and their aid, and the assistance of special classes of poor;
3. The care of strangers; and, lastly, we would consider the
theory of almsgiving, friendship or love, and charity.</p>

<p>1. As elsewhere, property is the basis of the family. Wife and
children are the property of the father. But the wife is held
in high respect. In the post-exilian period the virtuous wife
is represented as laborious as a Roman matron, a &ldquo;lady bountiful&rdquo;
to the poor, and to her husband wife and friend alike.
Monogamy without concubinage is now the rule&mdash;is taken for
granted as right. There is no &ldquo;exposure of children.&rdquo; The
slaves are kindly treated, as servants rather than slaves&mdash;though
in Roman times and afterwards the Jews were great slave-traders.
The household is not allowed to eat the bread of idleness.
&ldquo;Six days,&rdquo; it was said, &ldquo;<i>must</i> [not <i>mayest</i>] thou
work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Labour, if poor; but find work, if rich.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoever
does not teach his son business or work, teaches him robbery.&rdquo;
In Job xxxi., a chapter which has been called &ldquo;an inventory of
late Old Testament morality,&rdquo; we find the family life developed
side by side with the life of charity. In turn are mentioned the
relief of the widow, the fatherless and the stranger&mdash;the
classification of dependents in the Christian church; and the whole
chapter is a justification of the homely charities of a good family.
&ldquo;The Jewish religion, more especially in the old and orthodox form,
is essentially a family religion&rdquo; (C.G. Montefiore, <i>Religion
of Ancient Hebrews</i>).</p>

<p>In the early documents of the Church the fifth commandment
is made the basis of family life (cf. Eph. vi. 1; <i>Apost. Const.</i>
ii. 32, iv. 11&mdash;if we take the first six books of the <i>Apost. Const.</i>
as a composite production before <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 300, representing
Judaeo-Christian or Eastern church thought). But two points are
prominent. Duties are insisted on as reciprocal (cf. especially
St Paul&rsquo;s Epistles), as, <i>e.g.</i> between husband and wife, parent
and child, master and servant. Charity is mutual; the family
is a circle of reciprocal duties and charities. This implies a
principle of the greatest importance in relation to the social
utility of charity. Further reference will be made to it later.
Next the &ldquo;thou shalt love thy neighbour&rdquo; is translated from
its position as one among many sayings to the chief place as a
rule of life. In the <i>Didach&#275;</i> or <i>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i>
(Jewish-Christian, c. 90-120 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>) the first commandment in &ldquo;the
way of life&rdquo; is adapted from St Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel thus: &ldquo;First,
thou shalt love God who made thee; secondly, thy neighbour
as thyself; and all things whatsoever thou wouldst not have
done to thee, neither do thou to another.&rdquo; A principle is thus
applied which touches all social relations in which the &ldquo;self&rdquo;
can be made the standard of judgment. Of this also later. To
touch on other points of comparison: the earlier documents
seem to ring with a reiterated cry for a purer family life (cf. the
second, the negative, group of commandments in the <i>Didach&#275;</i>,
and the judgment of the apocalyptic writings, such as the
Revelations of Peter, &amp;c.); and, sharing the Jewish feeling, the
riper conscience of the Christian community formulates and
accepts the injunction to preserve infant life at every stage.
It advocates, indeed, the Jewish purity of family life with a
missionary fervour, and it makes of it a condition of church
membership. The Jewish rule of labour is enforced (<i>Ap. Const.</i>
ii. 63). If a stranger settle (<i>Didach&#275;</i>, xii. 3) among the brotherhood,
&ldquo;let him work and eat.&rdquo; And the father (<i>Constit.</i> iv. 11)
is to teach the children &ldquo;such trades as are agreeable and
suitable to their need.&rdquo; And the charities to the widow, the
fatherless, are organized on Jewish lines.</p>

<p>2. The sources of relief among the Jews were the three gifts of
corn: (1) the corners of the field (cf. Lev. xix. &amp;c.), amounting
to a sixtieth part of it; (2) the gleanings, a definite minimum
dropped in the process of reaping (Maimonides, <i>Laws of the
Hebrews relating to the Poor</i>, iv. 1); (3) corn overlooked and
left behind. So it was with the grapes and with all crops that
were harvested, as opposed, <i>e.g.</i> to figs, that were gathered from
time to time. These gifts were divisible three times in the day,
so as to suit the convenience of the poor (Maim. ii. 17), and the
poor had a right to them. They are indeed a poor-rate paid in
kind such as in early times would naturally spring up among an
agricultural people. Another gift &ldquo;out of the seed of the
earth,&rdquo; is the tithe. In the post-exilian period the septenniad
was in force. Each year a fiftieth part of the produce (Maim.
vi. 2, and Deut. xviii. 4) was given to the priest (the class which
in the Jewish state was supported by the community). Of the
remainder one-tenth went to the Levite, and one-tenth in three
years of the septennium was retained for pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
in two given to the poor. In the seventh year &ldquo;all things were
in common.&rdquo; Supplementing these gifts were alms to all who
asked; &ldquo;and he who gave less than a tenth of his means was a
man of evil eye&rdquo; (Maim. vii. 5). All were to give alms, even
the poor themselves who were in receipt of relief. Refusal
might be punished with stripes at the hand of the Sanhedrim.
At the Temple alms for distribution to the worthy poor were
placed by worshippers in the cell of silence; and it is said that
in Palestine at meal times the table was open to all comers. As
the synagogues extended, and possibly after the fall of Jerusalem
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70), the collections of alms was further systematized. There
were two collections. In each city alms of the box or chest
(<i>kupha</i>) were collected for the poor of the city on each Sabbath
eve (later, monthly or thrice a year), and distributed in money
or food for seven days. Two collected, three distributed. Three
others gathered and distributed daily alms of the basket
(<i>tamchui</i>). These were for strangers and wayfarers&mdash;casual
relief &ldquo;for the poor of the whole world.&rdquo; In the Jewish synagogue
community from early times the president (<i>parnass</i>) and
treasurer were elected annually with seven heads of the congregation
(see Abraham&rsquo;s <i>Jewish Life in the Middle Ages</i>, p. 54),
and sometimes special officers for the care of the poor. A staff
of almoners was thus forthcoming. In addition to these collections
were the <i>pruta</i> given to the poor before prayers (Maim. x.
15), and moneys gathered to help particular cases (cf. <i>Jewish
Life</i>, p. 322) by circular letter. There were also gifts at marriages
and funerals; and fines imposed for breach of the communal
ordinances were reserved for the poor. The distinctive feature
of the Jewish charity was the belief that &ldquo;the poor would not
cease out of the land,&rdquo; and that therefore on charitable grounds
a permanent provision should be made for them&mdash;a poor-rate, in
fact, subject to stripes and distraint, if necessary (Maim. vii. 10;
and generally cf. articles on &ldquo;Alms&rdquo; and &ldquo;Charity&rdquo; in the
<i>Jewish Encyclopaedia</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If we compare this with the early church we find the following
sources of relief: (1) The Eucharistic offerings, some consumed at
the time, some carried home, some reserved for the absent (see
Hatch, <i>Early Church</i>, p. 40). The ministration, like the Eucharist,
was connected with the love feast, and was at first daily (Acts ii.
42, vi. 1, and the <i>Didache</i>). (2) Freewill offerings and first-fruits
and voluntary tithes (<i>Ap. Con.</i> ii. 25) brought to the bishop and
used for the poor&mdash;orphans, widows, the afflicted and strangers
in distress, and for the clergy, deaconesses, &amp;c. (3) Collections
in churches on Sundays and week-days, alms-boxes and gifts to
the poor by worshippers as they entered church; also collections
for special purposes (cf. for Christians at Jerusalem). Apart from
&ldquo;the corners,&rdquo; &amp;c., the sources of relief in the Christian and Jewish
churches are the same. The separate Jewish tithe for the poor,
which (Maim. vi. II, 13) might be used in part by the donor as
personal charity, disappears. A voluntary tithe remains, in part
used for the poor. We do not hear of stripes and distraint, but in
both bodies there is a penitential system and excommunication
(cf. <i>Jewish Life</i>, p. 52), and in both a settlement of disputes within
the body (Clem. <i>Hov</i>. iii. 67). In both, too, there is the abundant
alms provided in the belief of the permanence of poverty and the duty
of giving to all who ask. As to administration in the early church
(Acts vi. 3), we find seven deacons, the number of the local Jewish
council; and later there were in Rome seven ecclesiastical relief
districts, each in charge of a deacon. The deacon acted as the
minister of the bishop (<i>Ep.</i> Clem, to Jam. xii.), reporting to him
and giving as he dictated (<i>Ap. Con.</i> ii. 30, 31). He at first combined
disciplinary powers with charitable. The presbyters also (Polycarp,
<i>Ad Phil.</i> 6, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 69-155), forming (Hatch, p. 69) a kind of bishop&rsquo;s
council, visited the sick, &amp;c. The bishop was president and treasurer.
The bishop was thus the trustee of the poor. By reason of the
churches&rsquo; care of orphans, responsibilities of trusteeship also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page870" id="page870"></a>870</span>
devolved on him. The temples were in pagan times depositories of
money. Probably the churches were also.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Great stress is laid by the Jews on the duty of gentleness
to the poor (Maim. x. 5). The woman was to have first attention
(Maim. vi. 13). If the applicant was hungry he was to be fed,
and then examined to learn whether he was a deceiver (Maim.
vii. 6). Assistance was to be given according to the want&mdash;clothes,
household things, a wife or a husband&mdash;and according
to the poor man&rsquo;s station in life. For widows and orphans the
&ldquo;gleanings&rdquo; were left. Both are the recognized objects of
charity (Maim. x. 16,17). &ldquo;The poor and the orphan were to be
employed in domestic affairs in preference to servants.&rdquo; The
dower was a constant form of help. The ransoming of slaves
took precedence of relief to the poor. The highest degree of
alms-deed (Maim. x. 7) was &ldquo;to yield support to him who is
cast down, either by means of gifts, or by loan, or by commerce,
or by procuring for him traffic with others. Thus his hand
becometh strengthened, exempt from the necessity of soliciting
succour from any created being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we compare the Christian methods we find but slight
difference. The absoluteness of &ldquo;Give to him that asketh&rdquo;
is in the <i>Didach&#275;</i> checked by the &ldquo;Woe to him that receives:
for if any receives having need, he shall be guiltless, but he that
has no need shall give account, ... and coming into distress
... he shall not come out thence till he hath paid the last
farthing.&rdquo; It is the duty of the bishop to know who is most
worthy of assistance (<i>Ap. Con.</i> ii. 3, 4); and &ldquo;if any one is in
want by gluttony, drunkenness, or idleness, he does not deserve
assistance, or to be esteemed a member of the church.&rdquo; The
widow assumes the position not only of a recipient of alms, but
a church worker. Some were a private charge, some were
maintained by the church. The recognized &ldquo;widow&rdquo; was
maintained: she was to be sixty years of age (cf. 1 Tim, v. 9 and
<i>Ap. Con.</i> iii. 1), and was sometimes tempted to become a bedes-woman
and gossipy pauper, if one may judge from the texts.
Remarriage was not approved. Orphans were provided for by
members of the churches. The virgins formed another class, as,
contrary to the earlier feeling, marriage came to be held a state
of lesser sanctity. They too seem to have been also, in part at
least, church workers. Thus round the churches grew up new
groups of recognized dependents; but the older theory of charity
was broad and practical&mdash;akin to that of Maimonides. &ldquo;Love
all your brethren, performing to orphans the part of parents, to
widows that of husbands, affording them sustenance with all
kindliness, arranging marriages for those who are in their prime,
and for those who are without a profession the means of necessary
support through employment: giving work to the artificer and
alms to the incapable&rdquo; (<i>Ep.</i> Clem, to James viii.).</p>

<p>4. The Jews in pre-Christian and Talmudic times supported
the stranger or wayfarer by the distribution of food (<i>tamchui</i>);
the strangers were lodged in private houses, and there were inns
provided at which no money was taken (cf. <i>Jewish Life</i>, p. 314).
Subsequently, besides these methods, special societies were
formed &ldquo;for the entertainment of the resident poor and of
strangers.&rdquo; There were commendatory letters also. These conditions
prevailed in the Christian church also. The <i>Xenodocheion</i>,
coming by direct succession alike from Jewish and Greek precedents,
was the first form of Christian hospital both for strangers
and for members of the Christian churches. In the Christian
community the endowment charity comes into existence in the
4th century, among the Jews not till the 13th. The charities
of the synagogue without separate societies sufficed.</p>

<p>We may now compare the conceptions of Jews and Christians
on charity with those of the Greeks. There are two chief exponents
of the diverse views&mdash;Aristotle and St Paul;
for to simplify the issues we refer to them only.
<span class="sidenote">Greek, Jewish and Christian thought.</span>
Thoughts such as Aristotle&rsquo;s, recast by the Stoic
Panaetius (185-112 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), and used by Cicero in his <i>De
Officiis</i>, became in the hands of St Ambrose arguments
for the direction of the clergy in the founding of the medieval
church; and in the 13th century Aristotle reasserts his influence
through such leaders of medieval thought as St Thomas Aquinas.
St Paul&rsquo;s chapters on charity, not fully appreciated and understood,
one is inclined to think, have perhaps more than any other
words prevented an absolute lapse into the materialism of almsgiving.
After him we think of St Francis, the greatest of a group
of men who, seeking reality in life, revived charity; but to the
theory of charity it might almost be said that since Aristotle and
St Paul nothing has been added until we come to the economic
and moral issues which Dr Chalmers explained and illustrated.</p>

<p>The problem turns on the conception (1) of purpose, (2) of the
self, and (3) of charity, love or friendship as an active force in
social life. To the Greek, or at least to Greek philosophic
thought, purpose was the measure of goodness. To have no
purpose was, so far as the particular act was concerned, to be
simply irrational; and the less definite the purpose the more
irrational the act. This conception of purpose was the touchstone
of family and social life, and of the civic life also. In no
sphere could goodness be irrational. To say that it was without
purpose was to say that it was without reality. So far as the
actor was concerned, the main purpose of right action was the
good of the soul (<span class="grk" title="psyche">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;</span>); and by the soul was meant the better
self, &ldquo;the ruling part&rdquo; acting in harmony with every faculty
and function of the man. With faculties constantly trained and
developed, a higher life was gradually developed in the soul.
We are thus, it might be said, what we become. The gates of
the higher life are within us. The issue is whether we will open
them and pass in.</p>

<p>Consistent with this is the social purpose. Love or friendship
is not conceived by Aristotle except in relation to social life.
Society is based on an interchange of services. This interchange
in one series of acts we call justice; in another friendship or
love. A man cannot be just unless he has acquired a certain
character or habit of mind; and hence no just man will act
without knowledge, previous deliberation and definite purpose.
So also will a friend fulfil these conditions in his acts of love or
friendship. In the love existing between good men there is
continuance and equality of service; but in the case of benefactor
and benefited, in deeds of charity, in fact, there is no such
equality. The satisfaction is on one side but often not on the
other. (The dilemma is one that is pressed, though not satisfactorily,
in Cicero and Seneca.) The reason for this will be found,
Aristotle suggests, in the feeling of satisfaction which men
experience in action. We realize ourselves in our deeds&mdash;throw
ourselves into them, as people say; and this is happiness.
What we make we like: it is part of us. On the other hand,
in the person benefited there may be no corresponding action,
and in so far as there is not, there is no exchange of service or the
contentment that arises from it. The &ldquo;self&rdquo; of the recipient
is not drawn out. On the contrary, he may be made worse,
and feel the uneasiness and discontent that result from this.
In truth, to complete Aristotle&rsquo;s argument, the good deed on one
side, as it represents the best self of the benefactor, should on the
other side draw out the best self of the person benefited. And
where there is not ultimately this result, there is not effective
friendship or charity, and consequently there is no personal or
social satisfaction. The point may be pushed somewhat further.
In recent developments of charitable work the term &ldquo;friendly
visitor&rdquo; is applied to persons who endeavour to help families
in distress on the lines of associated charity. It represents the
work of charity in one definite light. So far as the relation is
mutual, it cannot at the outset be said to exist. The charitable
friend wishes to befriend another; but at first there may be no
reciprocal feeling of friendship on the other&rsquo;s part&mdash;indeed,
such a feeling may never be created. The effort to reciprocate
kindness by becoming what the friend desires may be too painful
to make. Or the two may be on different planes, one not really
befriending, but giving without intelligence, the other not really
endeavouring to change his nature, but receiving help solely
with a view to immediate advantage. The would-be befriender
may begin &ldquo;despairing of no man,&rdquo; expecting nothing in return;
but if, in fact, there is never any kind of return, the friendship
actually fails of its purpose, and the &ldquo;friend&rsquo;s&rdquo; satisfaction is
lost, except in that he may &ldquo;have loved much.&rdquo; In any case,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page871" id="page871"></a>871</span>
according to this theory friendship, love and charity represent
the mood from which spring social acts, the value of which will
depend on the knowledge, deliberation and purpose with which
they are done, and accordingly as they acquire value on this
account will they give lasting satisfaction to both parties.</p>

<p>St Paul&rsquo;s position is different. He seems at first sight to ignore
the state and social life. He lays stress on motive force rather
than on purpose. He speaks as an outsider to the state, though
technically a citizen. His mind assumes towards it the external
Judaic position, as though he belonged to a society of settlers
(<span class="grk" title="paroikoi">&#960;&#940;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span>). Also, as he expects the millennium, social life and
its needs are not uppermost in his thoughts. He considers charity
in relation to a community of fellow-believers&mdash;drawn together
in congregations. His theory springs from this social base, though
it over-arches life itself. He is intent on creating a spiritual
association. He conceives of the spirit (<span class="grk" title="pneuma">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>) as &ldquo;an immaterial
personality.&rdquo; It transcends the soul (<span class="grk" title="psychê">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;</span>), and is the
Christ life, the ideal and spiritual life. Christians participate
in it, and they thus become part of &ldquo;the body of Christ,&rdquo;
which exists by virtue of love&mdash;love akin to the ideal life, <span class="grk" title="agapê">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>.
The word represents the love that is instinct with reverence,
and not love <span class="grk" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span> which may have in it some quality of passion.
This love is the life of &ldquo;the body of Christ.&rdquo; Therefore no act
done without it is a living act&mdash;but, on the contrary, must be
dead&mdash;an act in which no part of the ideal life is blended. On the
individual act or the purpose no stress is laid. It is assumed that
love, because it is of this intense and exalted type, will find the
true purpose in the particular act. And, when the expectation of
the millennium passed away, the theory of this ideal charity
remained as a motive force available for whatever new conditions,
spiritual or social, might arise. Nevertheless, no sooner does this
charity touch social conditions, than the necessity asserts itself
of submitting to the limitations which knowledge, deliberation
and purpose impose. This view had been depreciated or ignored
by Christians, who have been content to rely upon the strength
of their motives, or perhaps have not realized what the Greeks
understood, that society was a natural organism (Arist. <i>Pol.</i>
1253A), which develops, fails or prospers in accordance with
definite laws. Hence endless failure in spite of some success.
For love, whether we idealize it as <span class="grk" title="agapê">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span> or consider it a social
instinct as <span class="grk" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>, cannot be love at all unless it quickens the
intelligence as much as it animates the will. It cannot, except
by some confusion of thought, be held to justify the indulgence
of emotion irrespective of moral and social results. Yet, though
this fatal error may have dominated thought for a long time, it
is hardly possible to attribute it to St Paul&rsquo;s theory of charity
when the very practical nature of Judaism and early Christianity
is considered. In his view the misunderstanding could not arise.
And to create a world or &ldquo;body&rdquo; of men and women linked together
by love, even though it be outside the normal life of the
community, was to create a new form of religious organization,
and to achieve for it (so far as it was achieved) what, <i>mutatis
mutandis</i>, Aristotle held to be the indispensable condition of
social life, friendship (<span class="grk" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>), &ldquo;the greatest good of states,&rdquo;
for &ldquo;Socrates and all the world declare,&rdquo; he wrote, that &ldquo;the
unity of the state&rdquo; is &ldquo;created by friendship&rdquo; (Arist. <i>Pol.</i> ii.
1262 b).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It should, however, be considered to what extent charity in the
Christian church was devoid of social purpose, (1) The Jewish conceptions
of charity passed, one might almost say, in their completeness
into the Christian church. Prayer, the petition and the purging
of the mind, fasting, the humiliation of the body, and alms, as part of
the same discipline, the submissive renunciation of possessions&mdash;all
these formed part of the discipline that was to create the religious
mood. Alms henceforth become a definite part of the religious
discipline and service. Humility and poverty hereafter appear as
yoked virtues, and many problems of charity are raised in regard to
them. The non-Christian no less than the Christian world appreciated
more and more the need of self-discipline (<span class="grk" title="askêsis">&#7940;&#963;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>); and it seems
as though in the first two centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> those who may have thought
of reinvigorating society searched for the remedy rather in the
preaching and practice of temperance than in the application of
ideas that were the outcome of the observation of social or economic
conditions. Having no object of this kind as its mark, almsgiving
took the place of charity, and, as Christianity triumphed, the family
life, instead of reviving, continued to decay, while the virtues of
the discipline of the body, considered apart from social life, became
an end in themselves, and it was desired rather to annihilate instinct
than to control it. Possibly this was a necessary phase in a movement
of progress, but however that be, charity, as St Paul understood
it, had in it no part. (2) But the evil went farther. Jewish religious
philosophy is not elaborated as a consistent whole by any one writer.
It is rather a miscellany of maxims; and again and again, as in much
religious thought, side issues assume the principal place. The
direct effect of the charitable act, or almsgiving, is ignored. Many
thoughts and motives are blended. The Jews spoke of the poor
as the means of the rich man&rsquo;s salvation. St Chrysostom emphasizes
this: &ldquo;If there were no poor, the greater part of your sins
would not be removed: they are the healers of your wounds&rdquo;
(<i>Hom.</i> xiv., Timothy, &amp;c., St Cyprian on works and alms). Alms
are the medicine of sin. And the same thought is worked into the
penitential system. Augustine speaks of &ldquo;penance such as fasting,
almsgiving and prayer for breaches of the Decalogue&rdquo; (Reichel,
<i>Manual of Canon Law</i>, p. 23); and many other references might be
cited. &ldquo;Pecuniary penances (Ib. 154), in so far as they were relaxations
of, or substitutes for, bodily penances, were permitted
because of the greater good thereby accruing to others&rdquo; (and in
this case they were&mdash;<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1284&mdash;legally enforceable under English
statute law). The penitential system takes for granted that the
almsgiving is good for others and puts a premium on it, even though in
fact it were done, not with any definite object, but really for the
good of the penitent. Thus almsgiving becomes detached from
charity on the one side and from social good on the other. Still further
is it vulgarized by another confusion of thought. It is considered
that the alms are paid to the credit of the giver, and are realized
as such by him in the after-world; or even that by alms present
prosperity may be obtained, or at least evil accident avoided. Thus
motives were blended, as indeed they now are, with the result that
the gift assumed a greater importance than the charity, by which
alone the gift should have been sanctified, and its actual effect
was habitually overlooked or treated as only partially relevant.</p>

<p>(3) The Christian maxim of &ldquo;loving (<span class="grk" title="agapê">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>) one&rsquo;s neighbour as one&rsquo;s
self&rdquo; sets a standard of charity. Its relations are idealized according
as the &ldquo;self&rdquo; is understood; and thus the good self becomes
the measure of charity. In this sense, the nobler the self the completer
the charity; and the charity of the best men, men who
love and understand their neighbours best, having regard to their
chief good, is the best, the most effectual charity. Further, if in
what we consider &ldquo;best&rdquo; we give but a lesser place to social purpose
or even allow it no place at all, our &ldquo;self&rdquo; will have no sufficient
social aim and our charity little or no social result. For this &ldquo;self,&rdquo;
however, religion has substituted not St Paul&rsquo;s conception of the
spirit (<span class="grk" title="pneuma">&#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>), but a soul, conceived as endowed with a substantial
nature, able to enjoy and suffer quasi-material rewards and punishments
in the after-life; and in so far as the safeguard of this soul
by good deeds or almsgiving has become a paramount object, the
purpose of charitable action has been translated from the actual
world to another sphere. Thus, as we have seen, the aid of the poor
has been considered not an object in itself, but as a means by which
the almsgiver effects his own ulterior purpose and &ldquo;makes God his
debtor.&rdquo; The problem thus handled raises the question of reward
and also of punishment. Properly, from the point of view of charity,
both are excluded. We may indeed act from a complexity of
motives and expect a complexity of rewards, and undoubtedly a
good act does refresh the &ldquo;self,&rdquo; and may as a result, though not as
a reward, win approval. But in reality reward, if the word be used
at all, is according to purpose; and the only reward of a deed lies
in the fulfilment of its purpose. In the theory of almsgiving which
we are discussing, however, act and reward are on different planes.
The reward is on that of a future life; the act related to a distressed
person here and now. The interest in the act on the doer&rsquo;s part lies
in its post-mortal consequences to himself, and not either wholly
or chiefly in the act itself. Nor, as the interest ends with the act&mdash;the
giving&mdash;can the intelligence be quickened by it. The
questions &ldquo;How? by whom? with what object? on what plan?
with what result?&rdquo; receive no detailed consideration at all. Two
general results follow. In so far as it is thus practised, almsgiving
is out of sympathy with social progress. It is indeed alien to it.
Next also the self-contained, self-sustained poverty that will have
no relief and does without it, is outside the range of its thought and
understanding. On the other hand, this almsgiving is equally incapable
of influencing the weak and the vicious; and those who are
suffering from illness or trouble it has not the width of vision to
understand nor the moral energy to support so that they shall not
fall out of the ranks of the self-supporting. It believes that &ldquo;the
poor&rdquo; will not cease out of the land. And indeed, however great
might be the economic progress of the people, it is not likely that
the poor will cease, if the alms given in this spirit be large enough in
amount to affect social conditions seriously one way or the other.
When we measure the effects of charity, this inheritance of
divided thought and inconsistent counsels must be given its full
weight.</p>

<p>The sub-apostolic church was a congregation, like a synagogue,
the centre of a system of voluntary and personal relief, connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page872" id="page872"></a>872</span>
with the congregational meals (or <span class="grk" title="agapai">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#945;&#953;</span>) and the Eucharist,
<span class="sidenote">The organization of the parish and endowed charities.</span>
and under the supervision of no single officer or bishop. Out
of this was developed a system of relief controlled by
a bishop, who was assisted chiefly by deacons or
presbyters, while the <span class="grk" title="agapai">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#945;&#953;</span>, consisting of offerings
laid before the altar, still remained. Subsequently
the meal was separated from the sacrament, and
became a dole of food, or poor people&rsquo;s meal&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in
St Augustine&rsquo;s time in western Africa&mdash;and it was not allowed
to be served in churches (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 391). As religious asceticism
became dominant, the sacrament was taken fasting; it appeared
unseemly that men and women should meet together for such
purposes, and the <span class="grk" title="agapai">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#945;&#953;</span> fell out of repute. Simultaneously
it would seem that the parish <span class="grk" title="paroikia">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#943;&#945;</span> became from a congregational
settlement a geographical area.</p>

<p>The organization of relief at Rome illustrates both a type of
administration and a transition. St Gregory&rsquo;s reforms (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 590)
largely developed it. The first factor in the transition was the
church fund of the second period of Christianity, about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 150
to after 208 (Tertullian, <i>Apol</i>. 39). It served as a friendly fund,
was supported by voluntary gifts, and was used to succour and
to bury the poor, to help destitute and orphaned children,
old household slaves and those who suffered for the faith. This
fund is quite different from the <i>collegia tenuiorum</i> or <i>funeratica</i>
of the Romans, which were societies to which the members paid
stipulated sums at stated periods, for funeral benefits or for common
meals (J.P. Waltzing, <i>Corporations professionnelles chez
les Romains</i>, i. 313). It represents the charitable centre round
which the parochial system developed. That system was
adopted probably about the middle of the 3rd century, but in
Rome the diaconate probably remained centralized. At the
end of the 4th century Pope Anastasius had founded deaconries
in Rome, and endowed them largely &ldquo;to meet the frequent
demands of the diaconate.&rdquo; Gregory two hundred years later
reorganized the system. He divided the fourteen old &ldquo;regions&rdquo;
into seven ecclesiastical districts and thirty &ldquo;titles&rdquo; (or parishes).
The parishes were under the charge of sixty-six priests; the
districts were eleemosynary divisions. Each was placed under
the charge of a deacon, not (Greg. <i>Ep</i>. xi. and xxviii.) under the
priests (<i>presbyteri titularii</i>). Over the deacons was an archdeacon.
It was the duty of the deacons to care for the poor, widows,
orphans, wards, and old people of their several districts. They
inquired in regard to those who were relieved, and drew up under
the guidance of the bishop the register of poor (<i>matricula</i>).
Only these received regular relief. In each district was an
hospital or office for alms, of which the deacon had charge,
assisted by a steward (or <i>oeconomus</i>). Here food was given and
meals were taken, the sick and poor were maintained, and orphan
or foundling children lodged. The churches of Rome and of
other large towns possessed considerable estates, &ldquo;the patrimony
of the patron saints,&rdquo; and to Rome belonged estates in Sicily
which had not been ravaged by the invaders, and they continued
to pay to it their tenth of corn, as they had done since Sicily
was conquered. Four times a year (Milman, <i>Lat. Christ</i>, ii. 117)
the shares of the (1) clergy and papal officers, (2) churches and
monasteries, and (3) &ldquo;hospitals, deaconries and ecclesiastical
wards for the poor,&rdquo; were calculated in money and distributed;
and the first day in every month St Gregory distributed to the
poor in kind corn, wine, cheese, vegetables, bacon, meal, fish
and oil. The sick and infirm were superintended by persons
appointed to inspect every street. Before the pope sat down to his
own meal a portion was separated and sent out to the hungry at
his door. The Roman <i>plebs</i> had thus become the poor of Christ
(<i>pauperes Christi</i>), and under that title were being fed by <i>civica
annona</i> and <i>sportula</i> as their ancestors had been; and the deaconries
had superseded the &ldquo;regions&rdquo; and the &ldquo;steps&rdquo; from which
the corn had been distributed. The <i>hospitium</i> was now part of a
common organization of relief, and the sick were visited according
to Jewish and early Christian precedent. How far kindly Romans
visited the sick of their day we do not know. Alms and the
<i>annona</i> were now, it would seem, administered concurrently;
and there was a system of poor relief independent of the churches
and their alms (unless these, organized, as in Scottish towns,
on the ancient ecclesiastical lines, were paid wholly or in part to a
central diaconate fund). Much had changed, but in much Roman
thought still prevailed.</p>

<p>On lines similar to these the organization of poor relief in the
middle ages was developed. In the provinces in the later empire
the senate or <i>ordo decurionum</i> were responsible for the public
provisioning of the towns (Fustel de Coulanges, <i>La Gaule romaine</i>,
p. 251), and no doubt the care of the poor would thus in some
measure devolve on them in times of scarcity or distress. On
the religious side, on the other hand, the churches would probably
be constant centres of almsgiving and relief; and then, further,
when the Roman municipal system had decayed, each citizen
(as in Charlemagne&rsquo;s time, 742-814) was required to support his
own dependants&mdash;a step suggestive of much after-history.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The change in sentiment and method could hardly be more
strongly marked than by a comparison of &ldquo;the <i>Teaching</i>&rdquo; with
St Ambrose&rsquo;s (334-397) &ldquo;Duties of the Clergy&rdquo; (<i>De Officiis Ministrorum</i>).
For the old instinctive obedience to a command there is
now an endeavour to find a reasoned basis for charitable action.
Pauperism is recognized. &ldquo;Never was the greed of beggars greater
than it is now.... They want to empty the purses of the poor,
to deprive them of the means of support. Not content with a little,
they ask for more.... With lies about their lives they ask for
further sums of money.&rdquo; &ldquo;A method in giving is necessary.&rdquo; But
in the suggestions made there is little consistency. Liberality is
urged as a means of gaining the love of the people; a new and a
false issue is thus raised. The relief is neither to be &ldquo;too freely given
to those who are unsuitable, nor too sparingly bestowed upon the
needy.&rdquo; Everywhere there is a doctrine of the mean reflected
through Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De Officiis</i>, the doctrine insufficiently stated, as
though it were a mean of quantity, and not that rightly tempered
mean which is the harmony of opposing moods. The poor are not
to be sent away empty. Those rejected by the church are not to
be left to the &ldquo;outer darkness&rdquo; of an earlier Christianity. They
must be supplied if they are in want. The methodic giver is &ldquo;hard
towards none, but is free towards all.&rdquo; Consequently none are
refused, and no account is taken of the regeneration that may spring
up in a man from the effort towards self-help which refusal may
originate. Thus after all it appears that method means no more
than this&mdash;to give sometimes more, sometimes less, to all needy
people. In the small congregational church of early Christianity,
each member of which was admitted on the conditions of strictest
discipline, the common alms of the faithful could hardly have done
much harm within the body, even though outside they created and
kept alive a horde of vagrant alms-seekers and pretenders. Now
in this department at least the church had become the state, and
discipline and a close knowledge of one&rsquo;s fellow-Christians no longer
safeguarded the alms. From Cicero is borrowed the thought of
&ldquo;active help,&rdquo; which &ldquo;is often grander and more noble,&rdquo; but the
thought is not worked out. From the social side the problem is not
understood or even stated, and hence no principle of charity or of
charitable administration is brought to light in the investigation.
Still there are rudiments of the economics of charity in the praise of
Joseph, who made the people <i>buy</i> the corn, for otherwise &ldquo;they
would have given up cultivating the soil; for he who has the use
of what is another&rsquo;s often neglects his own.&rdquo; Perhaps, as St Augustine
inspired the theology of the middle ages, we may say that St
Ambrose, in the mingled motives, indefiniteness, and kindliness of this
book, stands for the charity of the middle ages, except in so far as
the movement which culminated in the brotherhood of St Francis
awakened the intelligence of the world to wider issues.</p>
</div>

<p>In Constantinople the pauperism seems to have been extreme.
The corn supplies of Africa were diverted there in great part
when it became the capital of the empire. This must have
left to Rome a larger scope for the development of the civic-religious
administration of relief. St Chrysostom&rsquo;s sermons give
no impression of the rise of any new administrative force, alike
sagacious and dominant. The appeal to give alms is constant,
but the positive counsel on charitable work is <i>nil</i>. The people
had the <i>annona civica</i>, and imperial gifts, corn, allowances
(<i>salaria</i>) from the treasury granted for the poor and needy,
and an annual gift of 50 gold pounds (rather more than £1400)
for funerals. Besides these there were many institutions, and
the begging and the almsgiving at the church doors. &ldquo;The land
could not support the lazy and valiant beggars.&rdquo; There were
public works provided for them; if they refused to work on
them they were to be driven away. The sick might visit the
capital, but must be registered and sent back (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 382); the
sturdy beggar was condemned to slavery. So little did alms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page873" id="page873"></a>873</span>
effect. And in the East monasticism seems to have produced
no firmness of purpose such as led to the organization of the
church and of charitable relief under St Gregory.</p>

<p>Another movement of the Byzantine period was the establishment
of the endowed charity. The Jewish synagogue long served
as a place for the reception of strangers&mdash;a religious <span class="grk" title="xenodocheion">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>.
Probably the strangers referred to in &ldquo;the <i>Teaching</i>&rdquo; were so
entertained. The table of the bishop and a room in his house
served as the guest-chamber, for which afterwards a separate
building was instituted. In the East the Jewish charitable
inn first appears, and there took place the earliest extension of
institutions. There was probably a demand for an elaboration
of institutions as social changes made themselves felt in the
churches. We have seen this in the case of the <span class="grk" title="agapê">&#7936;&#947;&#940;&#960;&#951;</span>. Similar
changes would affect other branches of charitable work. The
hospital (<i>hospitalium</i>, <span class="grk" title="xenodocheion">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>) is defined as a &ldquo;house of
God in which strangers who lack hospitality are received&rdquo;
(Suicerus, <i>Thesaur.</i>), a home separated from the church; and
round the church, out of the primitive <span class="grk" title="xenodocheion">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> of early
Christian times and the entertainment of strangers at the houses
of members of the community, would grow up other similar
charities. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 321 licence was given by Constantine to leave
property to the Church. The churches were thus placed in the
same position as pagan temples, and though subsequently
Valentinian (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 379) withdrew the permission on account
of the shameless legacy-hunting of the clergy, in that period
much must have been done to endow church and charitable
institutions. In the same period grew to its height the passion
for monasticism. This affected the parish and the endowed
charity alike. Under its influence the deacon as an almoner
tends to disappear, except where, as in Rome, there is an elaborate
system of relief. Nor does it seem that deaconesses, widows,
and virgins continued to occupy their old position as church
workers and alms-receivers. Naturally when marriage was
considered &ldquo;in itself an evil, perhaps to be tolerated, but still
degrading to human nature,&rdquo; and (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 385) the marriage of
the clergy was prohibited, men, except those in charge of parishes,
and women would join regular monastic bodies; the deacon,
as almoner, would disappear, and the &ldquo;widows&rdquo; and virgins
would become nuns. Thus there would grow up a large body
of men and women living segregated in institutions, and forming
a leisured class able to superintend institutional charities. And
now two new officers appear, the <i>eleemosynarius</i> or almoner
and the <i>oeconomus</i> or steward (already an assistant treasurer
to the bishop), who superintend and distribute the alms and
manage the property of the institution. (In the first six books
of the <i>Apost. Constit.</i>, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 300, these officers are not mentioned.)
In these circumstances the <i>hospitium</i> or hospital (<span class="grk" title="xenon">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="katagôgion">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#947;&#974;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>)
assumes a new character. It becomes in St Basil&rsquo;s hands
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 330-379) a resort not only for those who &ldquo;visit it from
time to time as they pass by, but also for those who need some
treatment in illness.&rdquo; And round St Basil at Caesarea there
springs up a colony of institutions. Four kinds principally are
mentioned in the Theodosian code: (i) the guest-houses (<span class="grk" title="xenodocheia">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>);
(2) the poor-houses (<span class="grk" title="ptôcheia">&#960;&#964;&#969;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>), where the poor (<i>mendici</i>)
were housed and maintained (the <span class="grk" title="ptôcheion">&#960;&#964;&#969;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span> was a general term
also applied to all houses for the poor, the aged, orphans and
sick); (3) there were orphanages (<span class="grk" title="orphanotropheia">&#8000;&#961;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>) for orphans
and wards; and (4) there were houses for infant children (<span class="grk" title="brephotropheia">&#946;&#961;&#949;&#966;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>).
Thus a large number of endowed charities had grown
up. This new movement it is necessary to consider in connexion
with the law relating to religious property and bequests, in its
bearing on the rule of the monasteries, and in its effect on the
family.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The sacred property (<i>res sacra</i>) of Roman law consisted of things
dedicated to the gods by the pontiff with the approval of the civil
authority, in turn, the people, the senate and the emperor. Things
so consecrated were inalienable. Apart from this in the empire,
the municipalities as they grew up were considered &ldquo;juristic persons&rdquo;
who were entitled to receive and hold property. In a similar position
were authorized <i>collegia</i>, amongst which were the mutual aid societies
referred to above. Christians associated in these societies would
leave legacies to them. Thus (W.M. Ramsay, <i>Cities and Bishoprics
of Phrygia</i>, I. i. 119) an inscription mentions a bequest (possibly by
a Christian) to the council (<span class="grk" title="synhedrion">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>) of the presidents of the dyers
in purple for a ceremonial, on the condition that, if the ceremony
be neglected, the legacy shall become the property of the gild for
the care of nurslings; and in the same way a bequest is left in Rome
(Orelli 4420) for a memorial sacrifice, on the condition that, if it be
not performed, double the cost be paid to the treasury of the corn-supply
(<i>fisco stationis annonae</i>). No unauthorized <i>collegia</i> could
receive a legacy. &ldquo;The law recognized no freedom of association.&rdquo;
Nor could any private individual create a foundation with separate
property of its own. Property could only be left to an authorized
juristic person, being a municipality or a <i>collegium</i>. But as the
problem of poverty was considered from a broader standpoint, there
was a desire to deal with it in a more permanent manner than by
the <i>annona civica</i>. The <i>pueri alimentarii</i> (see above) were considered
to hold their property as part of the <i>fiscus</i> or property of the state.
Pliny (<i>Ep.</i> vii. 18), seeking a method of endowment, transferred
property in land to the steward of public property, and then took
it back again subject to a permanent charge for the aid of children
of freemen. By the law of Constantine and subsequent laws no
such devices were necessary. Widows or deaconesses, or virgins
dedicated to God, or nuns (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 455), could leave bequests to a
church or memorial church (<i>martyrum</i>), or to a priest or a monk, or
to the poor in any shape or form, in writing or without it. Later
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 475) donations of every kind, &ldquo;to the person of any martyr,
or apostle, or prophet, or the holy angels,&rdquo; for building an oratory
were made valid, even if the building were promised only and not
begun; and the same rule applied to infirmaries (<span class="grk" title="nosokomoeia">&#957;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>) and
poor-houses (<span class="grk" title="ptôcheia">&#960;&#964;&#969;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#945;</span>)&mdash;the bishop or steward being competent
to appear as plaintiff in such cases. Later, again (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 528), contributions
of 50 solidi (say about £19, 10s.) to a church, hostel (<span class="grk" title="xenodocheion">&#958;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>),
&amp;c., were made legal, though not registered; while larger
sums, if registered, were also legalized. So (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 529) property
might be given for &ldquo;churches, hostels, poor-houses, infant and
orphan homes, and homes for the aged, or any such community&rdquo;
(<i>consortium</i>), even though not registered, and such property was
free from taxation. The next year (530) it was enacted that prescription
even for 100 years did not alienate church and charitable
property. The broadest interpretation was allowed. If by will
a share of an estate was left &ldquo;to Christ our Lord,&rdquo; the church of the
city or other locality might receive it as heir; &ldquo;let these, the law
says, belong to the holy churches, so that they may become the
alimony of the poor.&rdquo; It was sufficient to leave property to the poor
(<i>Corpus Juris Civilis</i>, ed. Krueger, 1877, ii. 25). The bequest was
legal. It went to the legal representative of the poor&mdash;the church.
Charitable property was thus church property. The word &ldquo;alms&rdquo;
covered both. It was given to pious uses, and as a kind of public
institution &ldquo;shared that corporate capacity which belonged to all
ecclesiastical institutions by virtue of a general rule of law.&rdquo; On
a <i>pia causa</i> it was not necessary to confer a juristic personality.
Other laws preserved or regulated alienation (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 477, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 530),
and checked negligence or fraud in management. The clergy had
thus become the owners of large properties, with the <i>coloni</i> and
slaves upon the estates and the allowances of civic corn (<i>annona
civica</i>); and (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 357) it was stipulated that whatever they acquired
by thrift or trading should be used for the service of the poor and
needy, though what they acquired from the labour of their slaves
in the labour houses (<i>ergastula</i>) or inns (<i>tabernae</i>) might be considered
a profit of religion (<i>religionis lucrum</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>Thus grew up the system of endowed charities, which with
certain modifications continued throughout the middle ages,
and, though it assumed different forms in connexion with gilds
and municipalities, in England it still retains, partially at least,
its relation to the church. It remained the system of institutional
relief parallel to the more personal almsgiving of the parish.</p>

<p>Monasticism, in acting on men of strong character, endowed
them with a double strength of will, and to men like St Gregory
it seemed to give back with administrative power the relentless
firmness of the Roman. In the East it produced the turbulent
soldiery of the church, in the West its missionaries; and each
mission-monastery was a centre of relief. But whatever the
services monasticism rendered, it can hardly be said to have
furthered true charity from the social standpoint, though out of
regard to some of its institutional work we may to a certain degree
qualify this judgment. The movement was almost of necessity
in large measure anti-parochial, and thus out of sympathy with
the charities of the parish, where personal relations with the poor
at their homes count for most.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The good and evil of it may be weighed. Monasticism working
through St Augustine helped the world to realize the mood of love
as the real or eternal life. Of the natural life of the world and its
responsibilities, through which that mood would have borne its
completest fruit, it took but little heed, except in so far as, by
creating a class possessed of leisure, it created able scholars, lawyers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page874" id="page874"></a>874</span>
and administrators, and disciplined the will of strong men. It had
no power to stay the social evils of the day. Unlike the friars, at
their best the monks were a class apart, not a class mixed up with
the people. So were their charities. The belief in poverty as a
fixed condition&mdash;irretrievable and ever to be alleviated without
any regard to science or observation, subjected charity to a perpetual
stagnation. Charity requires belief in growth, in the sharing
of life, in the utility and nobility of what is done here and now for
the hereafter of this present world. Monasticism had no thought
of this. It was based on a belief in the evil of matter; and from
that root could spring no social charity. Economic difficulties also
fostered monasticism. Gold was appreciated in value, and necessaries
were expensive, and the cost of maintaining a family was great.
It was an economy to force a son or a brother into the church. The
population was decreasing; and in spite of church feeling Marjorian
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 461) had to forbid women from taking the veil before forty, and
to require the remarriage of widows, subject to a large forfeit of
property (Hodgkin, <i>Italy and her Invaders</i>, ii. 420). Monasticism
was inconsistent with the social good. As to the family&mdash;like the
moderns who depreciate thrift and are careless of the life of the
family, the monks, believing that marriage was a lower form of
morality, if not indeed, as would at times appear, hardly moral at
all, could feel but little enthusiasm for what is socially a chief source
of health to the community and a well-spring of spontaneous charitable
feeling. By the sacerdotal-monastic movement the moralizing
force of Christianity was denaturalized. Among the secular clergy
the falsity of the position as between men and women revealed
itself in relations which being unhallowed and unrecognized became
also degrading. But worse than all, it pushed charity from its
pivot. For this no monasteries or institutions, no domination of
religious belief, could atone. The church that with so fine an intensity
of purpose had fostered chastity and marriage was betraying
its trust. It was out of touch with the primal unit of social life, the
child-school of dawning habits and the loving economy of the home.
It produced no treatise on economy in the older Greek sense of the
word. The home and its associations no longer retained their pre-eminence.
In the extreme advocacy of the celibate state, the
honourable development of the married life and its duties were
depreciated and sometimes, one would think, quite forgotten.</p>
</div>

<p>We may ask, then, What were the results of charity at the
close of the period which ends with St Gregory and the founding of
the medieval church?&mdash;for if the charity is reflected in the social
good the results should be manifest. Economic and social
conditions were adverse. With lessened trade the middle class
was decaying (Dill, <i>Roman Society in the Last Century of the
Western Empire</i>, p. 204) and a selfish aristocracy rising up. Municipal
responsibility had been taxed to extinction. The public
service was corrupt. The rich evaded taxation, the poor were
oppressed by it. There were laws upon laws, endeavours to
underpin the framework of a decaying society. Society was
bankrupt of skill&mdash;and the skill of a generation has a close bearing
on its charitable administration. While hospitals increased,
medicine was unprogressive. There were miserable years of
famine and pestilence, and constant wars. The care of the
poorer classes, and ultimately of the people, was the charge of the
church. The church strengthened the feeling of kindness for
those in want, widows, orphans and the sick. It lessened the
degradation of the &ldquo;actresses,&rdquo; and, co-operating with Stoic
opinion, abolished the slaughter of the gladiatorial shows. It
created a popular &ldquo;dogmatic system and moral discipline,&rdquo;
which paganism failed to do; but it produced no prophet of
charity, such as enlarged the moral imagination of the Jews.
It ransomed slaves, as did paganism also, but it did not abolish
slavery. Large economic causes produced that great reform.
The serf attached to the soil took the place of the slave. The
almsgiving of the church by degrees took the place of <i>annona</i> and
<i>sportula</i>, and it may have created pauperism. But dependence on
almsgiving was at least an advance on dependence founded on a
civic and hereditary right to relief. As the <i>colonus</i> stood higher
than the slave, so did the pauper, socially at any rate, free to
support himself, exceed the <i>colonus</i>. Bad economic conditions
and traditions, and a bad system of almsgiving, might enthral
him. But the way, at least, was open; and thus it became
possible that charity, working in alliance with good economic
traditions, should in the end accomplish the self-support of society,
the independence of the whole people.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part V.&mdash;Medieval Charity and its Development</p>

<p>It remains to trace the history of thought and administration
in relation to (1) the development of charitable responsibility in
the parish, and the use of tithe and church property for poor
relief; and (2) the revision of the theory of charity, with which
are associated the names of St Augustine (354-430), St Benedict
(480-542), St Bernard (1091-1153), St Francis (1182-1226), and
St Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). (3) There follows, in reference
chiefly to England, a sketch of the dependence of the poor under
feudalism, the charities of the parish, the monastery and the
hospital&mdash;the medieval system of endowed charity; the rise of
gild and municipal charities; the decadence at the close of the
15th century, and the statutory endeavours to cope with economic
difficulties which, in the 16th century, led to the establishment of
statutory serfdom and the poor-laws. New elements affect the
problem of charity in the 17th and 18th centuries; but it is not
too much to say that almost all these headings represent phases
of thought or institutions which in later forms are interwoven
with the charitable thought and endeavours of the present day.</p>

<p>Naturally, two methods of relief have usually been prominent:
relief administered locally, chiefly to residents in their own
homes, and relief administered in an institution. At
the time of Charlemagne (742-814) the system of
<span class="sidenote">The parish and charitable relief.</span>
relief was parochial, consisting principally of assistance
at the home. After that time, except probably in
England, the institutional method appears to have predominated,
and the monastery or hospital in one form or another gradually
encroached on the parish.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The system of parochial charity was the outcome, apparently,
of three conditions: the position and influence of the bishop, the
eleemosynary nature of the church funds, and the need of some
responsible organization of relief. It resulted in what might almost
be called an ecclesiastical poor-law. The affairs of a local church
or congregation were superintended by a bishop. To deal with the
outlying districts he detached priests for religious work and, as in
Rome and (774) Strassburg, deacons also for the administration
of relief. Originally all the income of the church or congregation
was paid into one fund only, of which the bishop had charge, and
this fund was available primarily for charitable purposes. Church
property was the patrimony of the poor. In the 4th century (IV.
Council of Carthage, 398) the names of the clergy were entered on
a list (<i>matricula</i> or <i>canon</i>), as were also the names of the poor, and
both received from the church their daily portion (cf. Ratzinger,
<i>Geschichte der kirchlichen Armenpflege</i>, p. 117). There were no
expenses for building. Before the reign of Constantine (306) very
few churches were built (Ratzinger, p. 120). Thus the early church
as has been said, was chiefly a charitable society. By degrees the
property of the church was very largely increased by gifts and
bequests, and in the West before St Gregory&rsquo;s time the division
of it for four separate purposes&mdash;the support of the bishop, of the
clergy, and of the poor, and for church buildings&mdash;still further
promoted decentralization. Apart from any special gifts, there was
thus created a separate fund for almsgiving, supervised by the bishop,
consisting of a fourth of the church property, the oblations (mostly
used for the poor), and the tithe, which at first was used for the
poor solely. The organization of the church was gradually extended.
The church once established in the chief city of a district would
become in turn the mother church of other neighbourhoods, and the
bishop or priest of the mother church would come to exercise supervision
over them and their parishes.</p>

<p>In France, which may serve as a good illustration, in the 4th century
(Ratzinger, p. 181) the civic organization was utilized for a
further change. The Roman provinces were divided into large
areas, <i>civitales</i>, and these were adopted by the church as bishop&rsquo;s
parishes or, as we should call them, dioceses; and the chief city
became the cathedral city. The bishop thus became responsible
in Charlemagne&rsquo;s time both for his own parish&mdash;that of the mother
church&mdash;and for the supervision of the parishes in the <i>civitas</i>, and
so for the sick and needy of the diocese generally. He had to take
charge of the poor in his own parish personally, keep the list of the
poor, and houses for the homeless. The other parishes were at first,
or in some measure, supported from his funds, but they acquired
by degrees tithe and property of their own and were endowed by
Charlemagne, who gave one or more manses or lots of land (cf.
Fustel de Coulanges, <i>Hist, des institutions politiques de l&rsquo;ancienne
France</i>, p. 360) for the support of each parish priest. The priests
were required to relieve their own poor so that they should not stray
into other cities (II. Counc. Tours, 567), and to provide food and
lodging for strangers. The method was indeed elaborated and
became, like the Jewish, that contradiction in terms&mdash;a compulsory
system of charitable relief. The payment of tithe was enforced by
Charlemagne, and it became a legal due (Counc. Frankfort, 794;
Arelat. 794). At the same time two other conditions were enforced.
Each person (<i>unusquisque fidelium nostrorum</i> or <i>omnes cives</i>) was
to keep his own family, <i>i.e.</i> all dependent on him&mdash;all, that is, upon
his freehold estate (<i>allodium</i>), and no one was to presume to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page875" id="page875"></a>875</span>
relief to able-bodied beggars unless they were set to work (Charlem.
<i>Capit</i>. v. 10). Thus we find here the germ of a poor-law system.
As in the times of the <i>annona civica</i>, slavery, feudalism, or statutory
serfdom, the burthen of the maintenance of the poor fell only in
part on charity. Only those who could not be maintained as
members of some &ldquo;family&rdquo; were properly entitled to relief, and
in these circumstances the officially recognized clients of the church
consisted of the gradually decreasing number of free poor and those
who were tenants of church lands.</p>

<p>Since 817 there has been no universally binding decision of the
church respecting the care of the poor (Ratzinger, p. 236). So long
ago did laicization begin in charity. In the wars and confusion of
the 9th and 10th centuries the poorer freemen lapsed still further
into slavery, or became <i>coloni</i> or bond servants; and later they
passed under the feudal rule. Thus the church&rsquo;s duty to relieve them
became the masters&rsquo; obligation to maintain them. Simultaneously
the activity of the clergy, regular and secular alike, dwindled. They
were exhorted to increase their alms. The revenues and property
of &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; were largely turned to private or partly ecclesiastical
purposes, or secularized. Legacies went wholly to the clergy, but
only the tithe of the produce of their own lands was used for relief;
and of the general tithe, only a third or fourth part was so applied.
Eventually to a large extent, but more elsewhere than in England
(Ratzinger, pp. 246, 269), the tithe itself was appropriated by nobles
or even by the monasteries; and thus during and after the 10th
century a new organization of charity was created on non-parochial
methods of relief. Alms, with prayer and fasting, had always been
connected with penance. But the character of the penitential
system had altered. By the 7th century private penance had superseded
the public and congregational penance of the earlier church
(<i>Dict. Christian Antiquities</i>, art. &ldquo;Penitence&rdquo;). To the penalties
of exclusion from the sacraments or from the services of the church
or from its communion was coupled, with other penitential discipline,
an elaborate penitential system, in which about the 7th century the
redemption of sin by the &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; of property, payments of
money fines, &amp;c., was introduced. (Cf. for instance Conc. Elberti:&mdash;Labbeus
i. 969 (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 305), with Conc. Berghamstedense, Wilkins,
Conc. p. 60 (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 696), and the Penitential (p. 115) and Canons
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 960), p. 236.) The same sin committed by an overseer (<i>praepositus
paganus</i>) was compensated by a fine of 100 <i>solidi</i>; in the
case of a <i>colonus</i> by a fine of 50. So amongst the ways of penitence
were entered in the above-mentioned Canons, to erect a church, and
if means allowed, add to it land ... to repair the public roads ...
&ldquo;to distribute,&rdquo; to help poor widows, orphans and strangers, redeem
slaves, fast, &amp;c.&mdash;a combination of &ldquo;good deeds&rdquo; which suggests a line
of thought such as ultimately found expression in the definition of
charities in the Charitable Uses Act of Queen Elizabeth. The confessor,
too, was &ldquo;<i>spiritualis medicus</i>,&rdquo; and much that from the point
of view of counsel would now be the work of charity would in his
hands be dealt with in that capacity. For lesser sins (cf. Bede (673-735),
<i>Hom.</i> 34, quoted by Ratzinger) the penalty was prayer, fasting
and alms; for the greater sins&mdash;murder, adultery and idolatry&mdash;to
give up all. Thus while half-converted barbarians were kept in
moral subjection by material penances, the church was enriched
by their gifts; and these tended to support the monastic and
institutional methods which were in favour, and to which, on the
revival of religious earnestness in the 11th century, the world looked
for the reform of social life.</p>
</div>

<p>To understand medieval charity it is necessary to return
to St Augustine. According to him, the motive of man in his
legitimate effort to assert himself in life was love or
desire (<i>amor</i> or <i>cupido</i>). &ldquo;All impulses were only
<span class="sidenote">Medieval revision of the theory of charity.</span>
evolutions of this typical characteristic&rdquo; (Harnack,
<i>History of Dogma</i> (trans.), v. iii.); and this was so
alike in the spiritual and the sensuous life. Happiness thus
depended on desire; and desire in turn depended on the
regulation of the will; but the will was regulated only by grace.
God was the <i>spiritualis substantia</i>; and freedom was the identity
of the will with the omnipotent unchanging nature. This
highest Being was &ldquo;holiness working on the will in the form of
omnipotent love.&rdquo; This love was grace&mdash;&ldquo;grace imparting itself
in love.&rdquo; Love (<i>caritas</i>&mdash;charity) is identified with justice; and
the will, the goodwill, is love. The identity of the will with the
will of God was attained by communion with Him. The after-life
consummated by sight this communion, which was here
reached only by faith. Such a method of thought was entirely
introspective, and it turned the mind &ldquo;wholly to hope, asceticism
and the contemplation of God in worship.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where St Augustine
indulges in the exposition of practical piety he has no theory
at all of Christ&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; To charity on that side he added
nothing. In the 11th century there was a revival of piety, which
had amongst its objects the restoration of discipline in the
monasteries and a monastic training for the secular clergy.
To this Augustinian thought led the way. &ldquo;Christianity was
asceticism and the city of God&rdquo; (Harnack vi. 6). A new religious
feeling took possession of the general mind, a regard and adoration
of the actual, the historic Christ. Of this St Bernard was
the expositor. &ldquo;Beside the sacramental Christ the image of the
historical took its place,&mdash;majesty in humility, innocence in
penal suffering, life in death.&rdquo; The spiritual and the sensuous
were intermingled. Dogmatic formulae fell into the background.
The picture of the historic Christ led to the realization of the
Christ according to the spirit (<span class="grk" title="kata pneuma">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945;</span>). Thus St Bernard
carried forward Augustinian thought; and the historic Christ
became the &ldquo;sinless man, approved by suffering, to whom the
divine grace, by which He lives, has lent such power that His
image takes shape in other men and incites them to corresponding
humility and love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Humility and poverty represented the conditions under
which alone this spirit could be realized; and the poverty must
be spiritual, and therefore self-imposed (&ldquo;wilful,&rdquo; as it was
afterwards called). This led to practical results. Poverty was
not a social state, but a spiritual; and consequently the poor
generally were not the <i>pauperes Christi</i>, but those who, like the
monks, had taken vows of poverty. From these premisses
followed later the doctrine that gifts to the church were not
gifts to the poor, as once they had been, but to the religious
bodies. The church was not the church of the poor, but of the
poor in spirit. But the immediate effect was the belief for a time,
apparently almost universal, that the salvation of society would
come from the monastic orders. By their aid, backed by the
general opinion, the secular clergy were brought back to celibacy
and the monasteries newly disciplined. But charity could not
thus regain its touch of life and become the means of raising
the standard of social duty.</p>

<p>Next, one amongst many who were stirred by a kindred
inspiration, St Francis turned back to actual life and gave a new
reality to religious idealism. For him the poor were once again
the <i>pauperes Christi</i>. To follow Christ was to adopt the life of
&ldquo;evangelical poverty,&rdquo; and this was to live among the poor the
life of a poor man. The follower was to work with his hands (as
the poor clergy of the early church had done and the clergy of
the early English church were exhorted to do); he was to receive
no money; he was to earn the actual necessaries of life, though
what he could not earn he might beg. To ask for this was a right,
so long as he was bringing a better life into the world. All in
excess of this he gave to the poor. He would possess no property,
buildings or endowments, nor was his order to do so. The fulness
of his life was in the complete realization of it now, without the
cares of property and without any fear of the future. Having a
definite aim and mission, he was ready to accept the want that
might come upon him, and his life was a discipline to enable him
to suffer it if it came. To him humility was the soul making
itself fit to love; and poverty was humility expanded from a
mood to a life, a life not guarded by seclusion, but spent amongst
those who were actually poor. The object of life was to console
the poor&mdash;those outside all monasteries and institutions&mdash;the
poor as they lived and worked. The movement was practically
a lay movement, and its force consisted in its simplicity and
directness. Book learning was disparaged: life was to be the
teacher. The brothers thus became observant and practical,
and afterwards indeed learned, and their learning had the same
characteristics. Their power lay in their practical sagacity,
in their treatment of life, outside the cloister and the hospital,
at first hand. They knew the people because they settled
amongst them, living just as they did. This was their method
of charity.</p>

<p>The inspiration that drew St Francis to this method was
the contemplation of the life of Christ. But it was more than
this. The Christ was to him, as to St Bernard, an ideal, whose
nature passed into that of the contemplating and adoring
beholder, so that, as he said, &ldquo;having lost its individuality, of
itself the creature could no longer act.&rdquo; He had no impulse
but the Christ impulse. He was changed. His identity was
merged in that of Christ. And with this came the conception of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page876" id="page876"></a>876</span>
gracious and finely ordered charity, moving like the natural
world in a constant harmonious development towards a definite
end. The mysticism was intense, but it was practical because it
was intense. In that lay the strength of the movement of the
true Franciscans, and in those orders that, whether called
heretical or not, followed them&mdash;Lollards and others. Religion
thus became a personal and original possession. It became
individual. It was inspired by a social endeavour, and for the
world at large it made of charity a new thing.</p>

<p>St Thomas Aquinas took up St Bernard&rsquo;s position. Renunciation
of property, voluntary poverty, was in his view
also a necessary means of reaching the perfect life; and the
feeling that was akin to this renunciation and prompted it was
charity. &ldquo;All perfection of the Christian life was to be attained
according to charity,&rdquo; and charity united us to God.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the system elaborated by St Thomas Aquinas two lines of
thought are wrought into a kind of harmony. The one stands
for Aristotle and nature, the other for Christian tradition and
theology. We have thus a duplicate theory of thought and action
throughout, both rational and theologic virtues, and a duplicate
beatitude or state of happiness correspondent to each. On the one
hand it is argued that the good act is an act which, in relation to
its object, wholly serves its purpose; and thus the measure of goodness
(<i>Prima Secundae Summae Theolog. Q.</i> xviii. 2) is the proportion
between action and effect. On the other hand, the act has to satisfy
the twofold law, human reason and eternal reason. From the point
of view of the former the cardinal factor is desire, which, made proportionate
to an end, is love (<i>amor</i>); and, seeking the good of others,
it loses its quality of concupiscence and becomes friendly love (<i>amor
amicitiae</i>). But this rational love (<i>amor</i>) and charity (<i>caritas</i>), the
theologic virtue, may meet. All virtue or goodness is a degree of
love (<i>amor</i>), if by virtue we mean the cardinal virtues and refer to the
rule of reason only. But there are also theologic virtues, which
are on one side &ldquo;essential,&rdquo; on the other side participative. As
wood ignited participates in the natural fire, so does the individual
in these virtues (II. II.<span class="sp">ae</span> lxii. l). Charity is a kind of friendship
towards God. It is received <i>per infusionem spiritus sancti</i>, and is
the chief and root of the theologic virtues of faith and hope, and on
it the rational virtues depend. They are not degrees of charity as
they are of (<i>amor</i>) love, but charity gives purpose, order and quality
to them all. In this sense the word is applied to the rational virtues&mdash;as,
for instance, beneficence. The counterpart of charity in social
life is pity (<i>misericordia</i>), the compassion that moves us to supply
another&rsquo;s want (<i>summa religionis Christianae in misericordia consistit
quantum ad exteriora opera</i>). It is, however, an emotion, not a virtue,
and must be regulated like any other emotion (... <i>passio est et
non virtus. Hic autem motus potest esse secundum rationem regulatus</i>,
II. II.<span class="sp">ae</span> xxx. 3). Thus we pass to alms, which are the instrument of
pity&mdash;an act of charity done through the intervention of pity. The
act is not done in order to purchase spiritual good by a corporal
means, but to merit a spiritual good (<i>per effectum caritatis</i>) through
being in a state of charity; and from that point of view its effect
is tested by the recipient being moved to pray for his benefactor.
The claim of others on our beneficence is relative, according to
consanguinity and other bonds (II. II.<span class="sp">ae</span> xxxi. 3), subject to the
condition that the common good of many is a holier obligation
(<i>divinius</i>) than that of one. Obedience and obligation to parents
may be crossed by other obligations, as, for instance, duty to the
church. To give alms is a command. Alms should consist of the
superfluous&mdash;that is, of all that the individual possesses after he has
reserved what is necessary. What is necessary the donor should
fix in due relation to the claims of his family and dependants, his
position in life (<i>dignitas</i>), and the sustenance of his body. On the
other hand, his gift should meet the actual necessities of the recipient
and no more. More than this will lead to excess on the recipient&rsquo;s
part (<i>ut inde luxurietur</i>) or to want of spirit and apathy (<i>ut aliis
remissio et refrigerium sit</i>), though allowance must be made for
different requirements in different conditions of life. It were better
to distribute alms to many persons than to give more than is necessary
to one. In individual cases there remains the further question
of correction&mdash;the removing of some evil or sin from another; and
this, too, is an act of charity.</p>

<p>It will be seen that though St Thomas bases his argument on a
duplicate theory of thought, action and happiness, part natural,
part theologic, and states fully the conditions of good action, he
does not bring the two into unison. Logically the argument should
follow that alms that fail in social benefit (produce <i>remissionem et
refrigerium</i>, for instance) fail also in spiritual good, for the two cannot
be inconsistent. But in regard to the former he does not press the
importance of purpose, and, in spite of his Aristotle, he misses the
point on which Aristotle, as a close observer of social conditions,
insists, that gifts without purpose and reciprocity foster the dependence
they are designed to meet. The proverb of the &ldquo;pierced cask&rdquo;
is as applicable to ecclesiastical as to political almsgiving, as has
often been proved by the event. The distribution of all &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo;
income in the form of alms would have the effect of a huge
endowment, and would stereotype &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; as a permanent and
unprogressive class. The proposal suggests that St Thomas contemplated
the adoption of a method of relief which would be like
a voluntary poor-law; and it is noteworthy that his phrase &ldquo;necessary
relief&rdquo; forms the defining words of the Elizabethan poor-law,
while he also lays stress on the importance of &ldquo;correction,&rdquo; which,
on the decline and disappearance of the penitential system, assumed
at the Reformation a prominent position in administration in relation
not only to &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; but also to offences against society, such as
idleness, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>On this foundation was built up the classification of acts of
charity, which in one shape or another has a long social tradition,
and which St Thomas quotes in an elaborated form&mdash;the seven
spiritual acts (<i>consule</i>, <i>carpe</i>, <i>doce</i>, <i>solare</i>, <i>remitte</i>, <i>fer</i>, <i>ora</i>),
counsel, sustain, teach, console, save, pardon, pray; and the
seven corporal (<i>vestio</i>, <i>poto</i>, <i>cibo</i>, <i>redimo</i>, <i>tego</i>, <i>colligo</i>, <i>condo</i>)
I clothe, I give drink to, I feed, I free from prison, I shelter,
I assist in sickness, I bury (II. II.<span class="sp">ae</span> xxxii. 2). These in subsequent
thought became &ldquo;good works,&rdquo; and availed for the
after-life, bringing with them definite boons. Thus charity
was linked to the system of indulgences. The bias of the act
of charity is made to favour the actor. Primarily the benefit
reverts to him. He becomes conscious of an ultimate reward
accruing to himself. The simplicity of the deed, the spontaneity
from which, as in a well-practised art, its freshness springs and
its good effects result, is falsified at the outset. The thought
that should be wholly concerned in the fulfilment of a definite
purpose is diverted from it. The deed itself, apart from the
outcome of the deed, is highly considered. An extreme inducement
is placed on giving, counselling, and the like, but none on
the personal or social utility of the gift or counsel. Yet the
value of these lies in their end. No policy or science of charity
can grow out of such a system. It can produce innumerable
isolated acts, which may or may not be beneficent, but it cannot
enkindle the &ldquo;ordered charity.&rdquo; This charity is, strictly speaking,
by its very nature alike intellectual and emotional. Otherwise
it would inevitably fail of its purpose, for though emotion
might stimulate it, intelligence would not guide it.</p>

<p>There are, then, these three lines of thought. That of St
Bernard, who invigorated the monastic movement, and helped
to make the monastery or hospital the centre of charitable
relief. That of St Francis, who, passing by regular and secular
clergy alike, revived and reinvigorated the conception of charity
and gave it once more the reality of a social force, knowing that
it would find a freer scope and larger usefulness in the life of the
people than in the religious aristocracy of monasteries. And
that of St Thomas Aquinas, who, analysing the problem of
charity and almsgiving, and associating it with definite groups
of works, led to its taking, in the common thought, certain
stereotyped forms, so that its social aim and purpose were
ignored and its power for good was neutralized.</p>

<p>We have now to turn to the conditions of social life in
which these thoughts fermented and took practical shape. The
population of England from the Conquest to the
14th century is estimated at between 1½ and 2½
<span class="sidenote">Charity and social conditions in England.</span>
millions. London, it is believed, had a population
of about 40,000. Other towns were small. Two or
three of the larger had 4000 or 5000 inhabitants. The
only substantial building in a village, apart perhaps from the
manor-house, was the church, used for many secular as well
as religious purposes. In the towns the mud or wood-paved huts
sheltered a people who, accepting a common poverty, traded
in little more than the necessaries of life (Green, <i>Town Life in
the 15th Century</i>, i. 13). The population was stationary. Famine
and pestilence were of frequent occurrence (Creighton, <i>Epidemics
in Britain</i>, p. 19), and for the careless there was waste at harvest-time
and want in winter. Hunger was the drill-sergeant of
society. Owing to the hardship and penury of life infant mortality
was probably very great (Blashill, <i>Sutton in Holdernesse</i>,
p. 123). The 15th century was, however, &ldquo;the golden age of
the labourer.&rdquo; Our problem is to ascertain what was the service
of charity to this people till the end of that century. In order
to estimate this we have to apply tests similar to those we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page877" id="page877"></a>877</span>
applied before to Greece and Rome and the pre-medieval
church.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Family.</i>&mdash;Largely Germanic in its origin, we may perhaps
set down as elemental in the English race what Tacitus said of the
Germans. They had the home virtues. They had a high regard
for chastity, and respected and enforced the family tie. The wife
was honoured. The men were poor, but when the actual pressure
of their work&mdash;fighting&mdash;was removed, idle. They were born
gamblers. Much toil fell upon the wife; but slavery was rather a
form of tenure than a Roman bondage. As elsewhere, there was in
England &ldquo;the joint family or household&rdquo; (Pollock and Maitland,
<i>English Law before Edward I.</i> i. 31). Each member of the community
was, or should be, under some lord; for the lordless man
was, like the wanderer in Homer, who belonged to no phratry,
suspected and dangerous, and his kinsfolk might be required to find
a lord for him. There was personal servitude, but it was not of one
complexion; there were grades amongst the unfree, and the general
advance to freedom was continuous. By the 9th century the larger
amount of the slavery was bondage by tenure. In the reign of
Edward I., though &ldquo;the larger half of the rural population was
unfree,&rdquo; yet the serf, notwithstanding the fact that he was his lord&rsquo;s
chattel, was free against all save his lord. A century later (1381)
villenage&mdash;that is payment for tenancy by service, instead of by
quit-rent&mdash;was practically extinguished. So steady was the progress
towards the freedom and self-maintenance of the individual and his
family.</p>

<p><i>The Manor.</i>&mdash;In social importance, next to the family, comes
the manor, the organization of which affected charity greatly on
one side. It was &ldquo;an economic unit,&rdquo; the estate of a lord on which
there were associated the lord with his demesne, tenants free of
service, and villeins and others, tenants by service. All had the use
of land, even the serf. The estate was regulated by a manor court,
consisting of the lord of the manor or his representative, and the free
tenants, and entrusted with wide quasi-domestic jurisdiction. The
value of the estate depended on the labour available for its cultivation,
and the cultivators were the unfree tenants. Hence the lord, through
the manor-court, required an indemnity or fine if a child, for instance,
left the manor; and similarly, if a villein died, his widow might have
to remarry or pay a fine. Thus the lord reacquired a servant and
the widow and her family were maintained. The courts, too, fixed
prices, and thus in local and limited conditions of supply and demand
were able to equalize them in a measure and neutralize some of the
effects of scarcity. In this way, till the reign of Edward I., and, where
the manor courts remained active, till much later, a self-supporting
social organization made any systematic public or charitable relief
unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>The Parish and the Tithe.</i>&mdash;The conversion of England in the
7th century was effected by bishops, accompanied by itinerant
priests, who made use of conventual houses as the centres of their
work. The parochial system was not firmly established till the
10th century (970). Then, by a law of Edgar, a man who had a
church on his own land was allowed to pay a third of his tithe to his
own church, instead of giving the whole of it to the minister or
conventual church. Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury (667), had
introduced the Carolingian system into England; and, accordingly,
the parish priest was required to provide for strangers and to keep
a room in his house for them. Of the tithe, a third and not a fourth
was to go to the poor with any surplus; and in order to have larger
means of helping them, the priests were urged to work themselves,
according to the ancient canons of the church (cf. Labbeus, IV.
Conc. Carthag. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 398). The importance of the tithe to the poor
is shown by acts of Richard II. and Henry IV., by which it was
enacted that, if parochial tithes were appropriated to a monastery,
a portion of them should be assigned to the poor of the parish. At
a very early date (1287) quasi-compulsory charges in the nature of
a rate were imposed on parishioners for various church purposes
(Pollock and Maitland, i. 604), though in the 14th and 15th centuries
a compulsory church rate was seldom made. Collections were made
by paid collectors, especially for Hock-tide (<i>q.v.</i>) money&mdash;gathered for
church purposes (Brand&rsquo;s <i>Antiquities</i>, p. 112). But there must have
been many varieties in practice. In Somersetshire the churchwardens&rsquo;
accounts (1349 to 1560) show that the parish contributed
nothing to the relief of the poor, and it seems probable that the
personal charities of the parishioners, and the charities of the gild
fellowships and of the parsonage house sufficed (Bishop Hobhouse,
<i>Churchwardens&rsquo; Accounts, 1349-1560</i>, Somerset Record Society).
Many parishes possessed land, houses and cattle, and received gifts
and legacies of all kinds. The proceeds of this property, if given
for the use of the parish generally, might, if necessary, be available
for the relief of the poor, but, if given definitely for their use, would
provide doles, or stock cattle or &ldquo;poor&rsquo;s&rdquo; lands, &amp;c. (Cf. Augustus
Jessopp, <i>Before the Great Pillage</i>, p. 40; and many instances in the
reports of the Charity Commissioners, 1818-1835.) Of the endowments
for parish doles very many may have disappeared in the break-up
of the 16th century. There were also &ldquo;Parish Ales,&rdquo; the proceeds
of which would be used for parish purposes or for relief. Further,
all the greater festivals were days of feasting and the distribution
of food; at funerals also there were often large distributions, and
also at marriages. The faithful generally, subject to penance, were
required to relieve the poor and the stranger. In the larger part of
England the parish and the vill were usually coterminous. In the
north a parish contained several vills. There were thus side by side
the charitable relief system of the parish, which at an early date
became a rating area, and the self-supporting system of the manor.</p>

<p><i>The Monasteries.</i>&mdash;As Christianity spread monasteries spread,
and each monastery was a centre of relief. Sometimes they were
established, like St Albans (796), for a hundred Benedictine monks
and for the entertainment of strangers; or sometimes without any
such special purpose, like the abbey of Croyland (reorganized 946),
which, becoming exceeding rich from its <i>diversorium pauperum</i>,
or almonry, &ldquo;relieved the whole country round so that prodigious
numbers resorted to it.&rdquo; At Glastonbury, for instance (1537),
£140 16s. 8d. was given away in doles. But documents seem to
prove (Denton, <i>England in Fifteenth Century</i>, p. 245) that the
relief generally given by monasteries was much less than is usually
supposed.</p>

<p>The general system may be described (cf. Rule, <i>St Dunst. Cant.
Archp.</i> p. 42, Dugdale; J.B. Clark, <i>The Observances</i>, Augustinian
Priory, Barnwell; Abbot Gasquet, <i>English Monastic Life</i>). The
almonry was usually near the church of the monastery. An almoner
was in charge. He was to be prudent and discreet in the distribution
of his doles (<i>portiones</i>) and to relieve travellers, palmers, chaplains
and mendicants (<i>mendicantes</i>, apparently the beggars recognized
as living by begging, such as we have noted under other social conditions),
and the leprous more liberally than others. The old and
infirm, lame and blind who were confined to their beds he was to
visit and relieve suitably (<i>in competenti annona</i>). The importunity
of the poor he was to put up with, and to meet their need as far as
he could. In the almonry there were usually rooms for the sick.
The sick outside the precincts were relieved at the almoner&rsquo;s discretion.
Continuous relief might be given after consultation with
the superior. All the remnants of meals and the old clothes of the
monks were given to the almoner for distribution, and at Christmas
he had a store of stockings and other articles to give away as
presents to widows, orphans and poor clerks. He also provided
the Maundy gifts and selected the poor for the washing of feet.
He was thus a local visitor and alms distributor, not merely at the
gate of the monastery but in the neighbourhood, and had also at
his disposal &ldquo;indoor&rdquo; relief for the sick. Separate from the rest
the house there was also a dormitory and rooms and the kitchen
for strangers. A <i>hospitularius</i> attended to their needs and novices
waited on them. Guests who were laymen might stay on, working
in return for board and lodging (Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. Christian Antiq.</i>,
&ldquo;Benedictine&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The monasteries often established hospitals; they served also as
schools for the gentry and for the poor; and they were pioneers of
agriculture. In the 12th century, in which many monastic orders
were constituted, there were many lavish endowments. In the 14th
century their usefulness had begun to wane. At the end of that
century the larger estates were generally held in entail, with the
result that younger sons were put into religious houses. This
worldliness had its natural consequences. In the 15th century,
owing to mismanagement, waste, and subsequently to the decline
of rural prosperity, their resources were greatly crippled. In their
relation to charity one or two points may be noted: (1) Of the small
population of England the professed monks and nuns with the parish
priests (Rogers, <i>Hist. Agric. and Prices</i>, i. 58) numbered at least
30,000 or 40,000. This number of celibates was a standing protest
against the moral sufficiency of the family life. On the other hand,
amongst them were the brothers and sisters who visited the poor
and nursed the sick in hospitals; and many who now succumb
physically or mentally to the pressure of life, and are cared for in
institutions, may then have found maintenance and a retreat in
the monasteries. (2) Bound together by no common controlling
organization, the monasteries were but so many miscellaneous
centres of relief, chiefly casual relief. They were mostly &ldquo;magnificent
hostelries.&rdquo; (3) They stood outside the parish, and they
weakened its organization and hampered its development.</p>

<p><i>The Hospitals.</i>&mdash;The revival of piety in the 11th century led to
a large increase in the number of hospitals and hospital orders.
To show how far they covered the field in England two instances
may be quoted. At Canterbury (Creighton, <i>Epidemics</i>, p. 87) there
were four for different purposes, two endowed by Lanfranc (1084),
one for poor, infirm, lame and blind men and women, and one outside
the town for lepers. These hospitals were put under the charge
of a priory, and endowed out of tithes payable to the secular clergy.
Later (Henry II.), a hospital for leprous sisters was established,
and afterwards a hospital for leprous monks and poor relations of
the monks of St Augustine&rsquo;s. In a less populous parish, Luton
(Cobbe, <i>Luton Church</i>), there were a hospital for the poor, an almshouse,
and two hospitals, one for the sick and one for the leprous.
The word &ldquo;leper,&rdquo; it is evident, was used very loosely, and was
applied to many diseases other than leprosy. There were hospitals
for the infirm and the leprous; the disease was not considered
contagious. The hospital in its modern sense was but slowly created.
Thus St Bartholomew&rsquo;s in London was founded (1123) for a master,
brethren and sisters, and for the entertainment of poor diseased
persons till they got well; of distressed women big with child till
they were able to go abroad; and for the maintenance, until the age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page878" id="page878"></a>878</span>
of seven, of all such children whose mothers died in the house.
St Thomas&rsquo;s (rebuilt 1228) had a master and brethren and three lay
sisters, and 40 beds for poor, infirm and impotent people, who
had also victual and firing. There were hospitals for many special
purposes&mdash;as for the blind, for instance. There were also many
hospital orders in England and on the continent. They sprang up
beside the monastic orders, and for a time were very popular:
brothers and sisters of the Holy Ghost (1198), sisters of St Elizabeth
(1207-1231), Beguines and Beghards (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beguines</a></span>), knights of St
John and others.</p>

<p><i>The Mendicant Orders.</i>&mdash;The Franciscans tended the sick and
poor in the slums of the towns with great devotion&mdash;indeed, the
whole movement tells of a splendid self-abandonment and an
intensity of effort in the early spring of its enthusiasm, and with
the aid of reform councils and reformations it lengthened out its
usefulness for two centuries.</p>
</div>

<p>As in the pre-medieval church, the system of relief is that
of charitable endowments&mdash;a marked contrast to
<span class="sidenote">Medieval endowed charities.</span>
the modern method of voluntary associations or
rate-supported institutions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) <i>The Church as Legatee.</i>&mdash;The church building among the
Teutonic races was not held by the bishop as part of what was
originally the charitable property of the church. It was assigned
to the patron saint of the church by the donor, who retained the
right of administration, of which his own patronage or right of
presentation is a relic. Subsequently, with the study of Roman
law, the conception of the church as a <i>persona ficta</i> prevailed; and
till the larger growth of the gilds and corporations it was the only
general legatee for charitable gifts. As these arise a large number
of charitable trusts are created and held by lay corporations; and
&ldquo;alms&rdquo; include gifts for social as well as religious or eleemosynary
purposes. (2) <i>Freedom from Taxation and Service.</i>&mdash;Gifts to the
church for charitable or other purposes were made in free, pure and
perpetual alms (&ldquo;<i>ad tenendum in puram et perpetuam eleemosynam
sine omni temporali servicio et consuetudine</i>&rdquo;). Land held under this
<i>frankalmoigne</i> was given &ldquo;in perpetual alms,&rdquo; therefore the donor
could not retract it; in free alms, therefore he could exact no services
in regard to it; and in pure alms as being free from secular
jurisdiction (cf. Pollock and Maitland). (3) <i>Alienation and
Mortmain.</i>&mdash;To prevent alienation of property to religious houses, with
the consequent loss of service to the superior or chief lords, a licence
from the chief lord was required to legalize the alienation (Magna
Carta, and Edw. I., <i>De viris religiosis</i>). Other statutes (Edw. I.
and Rich. II.) enacted that this licence should be issued out of
chancery after investigation; and the principle was applied to
civil corporations. The necessity of this licence was one lay check
on injurious alienation. (4) <i>Irresponsible Administration.</i>&mdash;Until
after the 13th century, when the lay courts had asserted their
right to settle disputes as to lands held in alms, the administration
of charity was from the lay point of view entirely irresponsible.
It was outside the secular jurisdiction; and civilly the professed
clergy, who were the administrators, were &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; They could
not sue or be sued except through their sovereign&mdash;their chief, the
abbot. They formed a large body of non-civic inhabitants free from
the pressure and the responsibilities of civil life.
(5) <i>Control</i>.&mdash;Apart
from the control of the abbot, prior, master or other head, the
bishop was visitor, or, as we should say, inspector; and abuses
might be remedied by the visit of the bishop or his ordinary. The
bishop&rsquo;s ordinary (2 Henry V. i. 1) was the recognized visitor of all
hospitals apart from the founder. The founder and his family
retained a right of intervention. Sometimes thus an institution
was reorganized, or even dissolved, the property reverting to the
founder (Dugdale, <i>Monasticon Anglicanum</i>, vi. 2. 715).
(6) <i>Cy-près.</i>&mdash;Charities
were, especially after Henry V.&rsquo;s reign, appropriated to
other uses, either because their original purpose failed or because
some new object had become important. Thus, for instance, a
college or hospital for lepers (1363) is re-established by the founder&rsquo;s
family with a master and priest, <i>quod nulli leprosi reperiebantur</i>;
and a similar hospital founded in Henry I.&rsquo;s time near Oxford has
decayed, and is given by Edward III. to Oriel College, Oxford, to
maintain a chaplain and poor brethren. Thus, apart from alienation
pure and simple, the principle of adaptation to new uses was put in
force at an early date, and supplied many precedents to Wolsey,
Edward VI. and the post-Reformation bishops. The system of
endowments was indeed far more adaptable than it would at first
sight seem to have been. (7) <i>The Sources of Income.</i>&mdash;The hospitals
were chiefly supported by rents or the produce of land; or, if
attached to monasteries, out of the tithe of their monastic lands or
other sources of revenue, or out of the appropriated tithes of the
secular clergy; or they might be in part maintained by collections
made, for instance, by a commissioner duly authorized by a formal
attested document, in which were recounted the indulgences by
popes, archbishops and bishops to those who became its benefactors
(Cobbe, p. 75); or, in the case of leper hospitals, by a leper with a
&ldquo;clapdish,&rdquo; who begged in the markets; or by a proctor, in the
case of more important institutions in towns, who &ldquo;came with his
box one day in every month to the churches and other religious
houses, at times of service, and there received the voluntary gifts
of the congregation&rdquo;; or they might receive inmates on payment,
and thus apparently a frequent abuse, decayed servants of the court
and others, were &ldquo;farmed out.&rdquo; (8) <i>Mode of Admission.</i>&mdash;The
admission was usually, no doubt, regulated by the prior or master.
At York, at the hospital of St Nicholas for the leprous, the conditions
of admission were: promise or vow of continence, participation in
prayer, the abandonment of all business, the inmate&rsquo;s property at
death to go to the house. This may serve as an example. The
master was usually one of the regular clergy. (9) <i>Decline of the
Hospitals.</i>&mdash;It is said that, in addition to 645 monasteries and
90 &ldquo;colleges&rdquo; and many chantries, Henry VIII. suppressed 110
hospitals (Speed&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i>, p. 778). The numbers seem small.
In the economic decline at the end of the 15th and beginning of the
16th centuries many hospitals may have lapsed.</p>
</div>

<p>In the 15th century the towns grew in importance. First the
wool trade and then the cloth trade flourished, and the English
developed a large shipping trade. The towns grew up
like &ldquo;little principalities&rdquo;; and for the advancement
<span class="sidenote">Gild and municipal charities.</span>
of trade, gilds, consisting alike of masters and workmen,
were formed, which endeavoured to regulate and then
to monopolize the market. By degrees the corporations of the
towns were worked in their interests, and the whole commercial
system became restrictive and inadaptable. Meanwhile the
towns attracted newcomers; freedom from feudal obligations
was gained with comparative ease; and a new <i>plebs</i> was congregating,
a population of inhabitants not qualified as burghers
or gild members, women, sons living with their fathers, menial
servants and apprentices. There was thus an increasing restriction
imposed on trade, coupled with a growing <i>plebs</i>. Naturally,
then, lay charities sprang up for members of gilds, and for
burghers and for the commonalty. Men left estates to their gilds
to maintain decayed members in hospitals, almshouses or otherwise,
to educate their children, portion their daughters, and to
assist their widows. The middle-class trader was thus in great
measure insured against the risks of life. The gilds were one
sign of the new temper and wants of burghers freed from feudalism.
Another sign was a new standard of manners. Rules and
saws, Hesiodic in their tone, became popular&mdash;in regard, for
instance, to such a question as &ldquo;how to enable a man to live
on his means, and to keep himself and those belonging to him.&rdquo;
The boroughs established other charities also, hospitals and almshouses
for the people, a movement which, like that of the gilds,
began very early&mdash;in Italy as early as the 9th century. They
sometimes gave outdoor relief also to registered poor (Green i. 41),
and they had in large towns courts of orphans presided over by
the mayor and aldermen, thus taking over a duty that previously
had been one of conspicuous importance in the church. As early
as 1257 in Westphalian towns there was a rough-and-ready
system of Easter relief of the poor; and in Frankfort in 1437
there was a town council of almoners with a systematic programme
of relief (Ratzinger, p. 352). Thus at the close of the
middle ages the towns were gradually assuming what had been
charitable functions of the church.</p>

<p>While a new freedom was being attained by the labourer in
the country and the burgher in the town, the difficulty of obtaining
a sufficient supply of labour for agriculture must
have been constant, especially at every visitation of
<span class="sidenote">Statutory wage control.</span>
plague and famine. In accordance with a general
policy of state regulation which was to control and
supervise industry, agriculture and poor relief and to repress
vagrancy by gaols and houses of correction, the state stepped
in as arbiter and organizer. By Statutes of Labourers beginning
in 1351 (25 Edw. III. 135), it aimed at enforcing a settled wage
and restraining migration. From 1351 it endeavoured to suppress
mendicity, and in part to systematize it in the interest of infirm
and aged mendicants. Each series of enactments is the natural
complement of the other. In the main their signification, from
the point of view of charity, lies in the fact that they represent
a persistent endeavour to prevent social unsettlement and in
part the distress which unsettlement causes, and which vagrancy
in some measure indicates, by keeping the people within the
ranks of recognized dependence, the settled industry of the
crafts and of agriculture, or forcing them back into it by fear
of the gaol or the stocks. The extreme point of this policy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page879" id="page879"></a>879</span>
reached when by the laws of Edward VI. and Elizabeth the
&ldquo;rogue, vagabond or sturdy beggar&rdquo; was branded with an <b>R</b>
on the shoulder and handed over as a bondman for a period to any
one who would take him. On the other hand, it was desired
that relief should be a means of preventing migration. In any
time of general pressure there is a desire to organize mendicity,
to prevent the wandering of beggars, to create a kind of settled
poor, distinguished from the rest as infirm and not able-bodied,
and to keep these at least at home sufficiently supported by local
and parochial relief; and this, in its simpler form all the world
over, has in the past been by response to public begging. The
argument may be summed up thus: We cannot have begging,
which implies that the beggar is cared for by no one, belongs
to no one, and therefore throws himself on the world at large.
Therefore, if he is able-bodied he must be punished as unsocial,
for it is his fault that he belongs to no one; or we must make
him some one&rsquo;s dependant, and so keep him; or if he is infirm,
and therefore of no service to any one&mdash;if no one will keep him&mdash;we
must organize his mendicity, for such mendicity is justified.
If he cannot dig for the man to whom he does or should belong,
he must beg. Then out of the failure to organize mendicity&mdash;for
relief of itself is no remedy, least of all casual relief&mdash;a
poor-law springs up, which, afterwards associated with the
provision of employment, will, it is hoped, make relief in some
measure remedial by increasing its quantity by means of compulsory
levies. This argument, which combined statutory wage
control and statutory poor relief, seems to have been firmly
bedded in the English legislative mind for more than two centuries,
from 1351 till after 1600; and until 1834 these two series of laws
effectually reduced the English labourer to a new industrial
dependence. To people imbued with ideas of feudalism the way
of escape from villenage seemed to be not independence, but
a new reversion to it.</p>

<p>Many elements produced the social and economic catastrophe
of the 16th century, for the condition into which the country
fell can hardly be considered less than a catastrophe.
With the growing independence of the people there was
<span class="sidenote">The decadence.</span>
created after the 13th century an unsettled &ldquo;masterless&rdquo;
class, a residue of failure resulting from social changes,
which was large and important enough to call for legislation.
In the 15th century, &ldquo;the golden age of the English labourer,&rdquo;
the towns increased and flourished. Both town and country did
well. At the end of the century came the decadence. The
measure of the strain, when perhaps it had reached its lowest
level, is indicated by the following comparison: &ldquo;The cost of
a peasant&rsquo;s family of four in the early part of the 14th century
was £3:4:9; after 1540 it was £8&rdquo; (Rogers, <i>Hist, of Agric. and
Prices</i>, iv. 756).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The cause of this has now been fairly investigated. The value
of land in the 13th century generally depended chiefly on &ldquo;the
head of labour&rdquo; retained upon it. Its fertility depended on mainoeuvre
(manure). To keep labour upon it was therefore the aim
of the lord or owner. The enclosing of lands for sheep began early,
and in the time of Edward III., in the great days of the woolstaple,
must have been extensive. So long as the demand for the exportation
of wool, and then for its consumption at home in the cloth trade,
continued, the towns prospered, and the enclosures did not become
a grievance. Even before the reign of Henry VII., with the decay
of trade, the towns decayed, and their population in some cases
diminished extraordinarily. This reacted on the country, where the
great families had already become impoverished, and were hardly
able to support their retainers. In Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time the lands of
the religious houses were confiscated. Worked on old lines, the
custom of tillage remained in force on them. Accordingly, when
these estates fell into private hands they were transferred subject
to the condition that they should be tilled as heretofore. The condition
was evaded by the new owners, and the disbandment of farm
labourers went on apace. In England and Wales these changes, it is
said, affected a third of the country, more than 12,000,000 acres, if
the estimates be correct, or rather a third of the best land in the
kingdom. With towns decaying, the effect of this must have been
terrible. What were really &ldquo;latifundia&rdquo; were created, &ldquo;great
landes,&rdquo; &ldquo;enclosures of a mile or two or thereabouts ... destroying
thereby not only the farms and cottages within the same circuits,
but also the towns and villages adjoining.&rdquo; A herdsman and his
wife took the place of eighteen to twenty-four farm hands. The
people thus set wandering could only join the wanderers from the
decaying towns. At the same time the economic difficulty was
aggravated by a new patrician or commercial greed; and once more
the land question&mdash;the absorption of property into a few hands
instead of its free exchange&mdash;led to lasting social demoralization.
A few years after the alienation of the monasteries the coinage
(1543) was debased. By this means prices were arbitrarily raised,
and wages were increased nominally; but nevertheless the price
of necessaries was &ldquo;so enhanced&rdquo; that neither &ldquo;the poor labourers
can live with their wages that is limited by your grace&rsquo;s laws, nor
the artificers can make, much less sell, their wares at any reasonable
price&rdquo; (Lamond, <i>The Commonweal of this Realm of England</i>, p. xlvii).
No social reformation, such as the charitable instincts of Wycliffe,
More, Hales, Latimer and other men suggested, was attempted, or
at least persistently carried out. In towns the organization of labour
had become restrictive, exclusive and inadaptable, or, judged from
the moral standpoint, uncharitable. There had been a time of plenty
and extravagance, of which in high quarters the famous &ldquo;field of
the cloth of gold&rdquo; was typical; and probably, in accordance with
the frequently observed law of social economics, as the advance in
wages and their purchasing power in the earlier part of the 15th
century had not been accompanied by a simultaneous advance in
self-discipline and intelligent expenditure, it resulted in part in
lessened competence and industrial ability on the part of the workmen,
and thus in the end produced pauperism.</p>
</div>

<p>The poverty of the country was very great in the reigns of
Edward VI. and Elizabeth. Adversity then taught the people
new manners, and households became more simple and thrifty.
In the reign of James I., with enforced economy and thrift, a
&ldquo;slow but substantial improvement in agriculture&rdquo; took place,
and a new growth of commercial enterprise. The vigour of the
municipalities had abated, so that in Henry VIII.&rsquo;s time they
had become the very humble servants of the government;
and the government, on the other hand, had become strongly
centralized&mdash;in itself a sign of the general withdrawal of self-sustaining
activity in all administration, in the administration
of charitable relief no less than in other departments. A system
of endowed charities had been built up, supported chiefly by
rents from landed property. These now had disappeared, and
thus the means of relief, which Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth
might have utilized at a time of general distress, had been dissipated
by the acts of their predecessors. The civil independence
of the monasteries and religious houses might have been justified,
possibly, when they were engaged in missionary work and were
instilling into the people the precepts of a higher moral law than
that which was in force around them. But afterwards, as the
ability and intelligence of the community increased, their privileges
became more and more antagonistic to charity, and tended
to create a non-social and even anti-social ecclesiastical democracy
actuated by aims and interests in which the general good of the
people had little or no place. There was a growing alienation
between religious tradition and secular opinion, as Lollardism
slowly permeated the thought of the people and led the way
to the Reformation. While this alienation existed no national
system of charity, civic and yet religious, could be created. But
worse than all, the ideal of charity had been degraded. A self-regarding
system of relief had superseded charity, and it was
productive of nothing but alms, large or small, isolated and unmethodic,
given with a wrong bias, and thus almost inevitably
with evil results. Out of this could spring no vigorous co-operative
charity. Charity&mdash;not relief&mdash;indeed seemed to have left
the world. The larger issues were overlooked. Then the property
of the hospitals and the gilds was wantonly confiscated, though
the poor had already lost that share in the revenues of the church
to which at one time they were admitted to have a just claim.
A new beginning had to be made. The obligations of charity had
to be revived. A new organization of charitable relief had to
be created, and that with an empty exchequer and after a vast
waste of charitable resources. There were signs of a new congregational
and parochial energy, yet the task could not be
entrusted to the religious bodies, divided and disunited as they
were. In their stead it could be imposed only on some authority
which represented the general community, such as municipalities;
and in spite of the centralization of the government there seemed
some hope of creating a system of relief in connexion with them.
They were tried, and, very naturally, failed. In the poverty of
the time it seemed that the poor could be relieved only by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page880" id="page880"></a>880</span>
compulsory rate, and the administration of statutory relief
naturally devolved on the central government&mdash;the only vigorous
administrative body left in the country. The government might
indeed have adopted the alternative of letting the industrial
difficulties of the country work themselves out, but they had
inherited a policy of minute legislative control, and they continued
it. Revising previous statutes, they enacted the Poor Law,
which still remains on the statute book. It could be no remedy
for social offences against charity and the community. But in
part at least it was successful. It helped to conceal the failure
to find a remedy.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Part VI.&mdash;After the Reformation</p>

<p>During the Reformation, which extended, it should be understood,
from the middle of the 14th century to the reign of James I.,
the groundwork of the theory of charity was being
recast. The old system and the narrow theory on which
<span class="sidenote">The Reformation theory of charity.</span>
it had come to depend were discredited. The recoil
is startling. To a very large extent charitable administration
had been in the hands of men and women who, as
an indispensable condition to their participation in it, took
the vows of obedience, chastity and &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; poverty. Now
this was all entirely set aside. It was felt (see <i>Homilies on Faith
and Good Works, &amp;c.</i>, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1547) that socially and morally the
method had been a failure. The vow of obedience, it was argued,
led to a general disregard of the duties of civic and family life.
Those who bound themselves by it were outside the state and
did not serve it. In regard to chastity the <i>Homily</i> states the
common opinion: &ldquo;How the profession of chastity was kept,
it is more honesty to pass over in silence and let the world judge
of what is well known.&rdquo; As to wilful poverty, the regulars, it
is urged, were not poor, but rich, for they were in possession of
much wealth. Their property, it is true, was held <i>in communi</i>,
and not personally, but nevertheless it was practically theirs,
and they used it for their personal enjoyment; and &ldquo;for all
their riches they might never help father nor mother, nor others
that were indeed very needy and poor, without the license of
their father abbot&rdquo; or other head. This was the negative position.
The positive was found in the doctrine of justification&mdash;the central
point in the discussions of the time, a plant from the garden of
St Augustine. Justification was the personal conviction of a
lively (or living) faith, and was defined as &ldquo;a true trust and
confidence of the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
and a stedfast hope of all good things to be received at His hands.&rdquo;
Without this justification there could be no good works. They
were the signs of a lively faith and grew out of it. Apart from
it, what seemed to be &ldquo;good works&rdquo; were of the nature of sin,
phantom acts productive of nothing, &ldquo;birds that were lost,
unreal.&rdquo; So were the works of pagans and heretics. The
relation of almsgiving to religion was thus entirely altered. The
personal reward here or hereafter to the actor was eliminated.
The deed was good only in the same sense in which the doer was
good; it had in itself no merit. This was a great gain, quite
apart from any question as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of
the Protestant scheme of salvation. The deed, it was realized,
was only the outcome of the doer, the expression of himself,
what he was as a whole, neither better nor worse. Logically
this led to the discipline of the intelligence and the emotions,
and undoubtedly &ldquo;justification&rdquo; to very many was only consistent
with such discipline and implied it. Thus under a new
guise the old position of charity reasserted itself. But there were
other differences.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The relation of charity to prayer, fasting, almsgiving and penance
was altsred. The prayerful contemplation of the Christ was preserved
in the mysticism of Protestantism; but it was dissociated
from the &ldquo;historic Christ,&rdquo; from the fervent idealization of whom
St Francis drew his inspiration and his active charitable impulse.
The tradition did not die out, however. It remained with many,
notably with George Herbert, of whom it made, not unlike St Francis,
a poet as well as a practical parish priest; but the absence of it
indicated in much post-Reformation endeavour a want, if not of
devotion, yet of intensity of feeling which may in part account for
the fact that sectarianism in relief has since proved itself stronger
than charity, instead of yielding to charity as its superior and its
organizer. Fasting was parted from prayer and almsgiving. It
was &ldquo;a thing not of its own proper nature good as the love of father
or mother or neighbour, but according to its end.&rdquo; Almsgiving also
as a &ldquo;work&rdquo; disappeared and with it a whole series of inducements
that from the standpoint of the pecuniary and material supply of
relief had long been active. It was no wonder that the preachers
advocated it in vain, and reproached their hearers with their diminished
bounty to the poor; the old personal incentive had gone, and
could only gradually be superseded by the spontaneous activity of
personal religion very slowly wedding itself to true views of social
duty and purpose. Penance, once so closely related to almsgiving,
passed out of sight. Charity, the love of God and our neighbour, had
two offices, it was said, &ldquo;to cherish good and harmless men&rdquo; and
&ldquo;to correct and punish vice without regard to persons.&rdquo; Correction
as a means of discipline takes the place of penance, and it becomes
judicial, regulating and controlling church membership by the
authority of the church, a congregation, minister or elder; or dealing
with laziness or ill-doing through the municipality or state, in
connexion with what now first appear, not prisons, but houses of
correction.</p>
</div>

<p>The religious life was to be democratic&mdash;not in religious
bodies, but in the whole people; and in a new sense&mdash;in relation
to family and social life&mdash;it was to be moral. That was the
significance of the Reformation for charity.</p>

<p>Consistently with this movement of religious activity towards
a complete fulfilment of the duties of civic life, the older classical
social theory, fostered by the Renaissance, assumed a
new influence&mdash;the great conception of the state as a
<span class="sidenote">The organization of municipal relief.</span>
community bound together by charity and friendship,
&ldquo;We be not born to ourselves,&rdquo; it was said, &ldquo;but
partly to the use of our country, of our parents, of our
kinsfolk, and partly of our friends and neighbours; and therefore
all good virtues are grafted on us naturally, whose effects be
to do good to others, when it showeth forth the image of God
in man, whose property is ever to do good to others&rdquo; (Lamond,
p. 14). Economic theory also changed. Instead of the medieval
opinion of the &ldquo;theologian or social preacher,&rdquo; that &ldquo;trade
could only be defended on the ground that honestly conducted
it made no profit&rdquo; (Green, ii. 71), we have a recognition of the
advantages resulting from exchange, and individual interests,
it is argued, are not necessarily inconsistent with those of the
state, but are, on the contrary, a source of solid good to the whole
community.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Municipal laws for the suppression of the mendicity of the able-bodied
and the organization of relief on behalf of the infirm were
common in England and on the continent (Colmar, 1362; Nuremberg,
1478; Strassburg, 1523; London, 1514). Vives (Ehrle, <i>Beitrage
zur Geschichte und Reform der Armenpflege</i>, p. 26), a Spaniard, who
had been at the court of Henry VIII., in a book translated into
several languages and widely read, seems to have summed up the
thought of the time in regard to the management of the poor.
He divided them into three classes: those in hospitals and poor-houses,
the public homeless beggars and the poor at home. He
would have a census taken of the number of each class in the town,
and information obtained as to the causes of their distress. Then
he would establish a central organization of relief under the magistrates.
Work was to be supplied for all, while begging was strictly
forbidden. Non-settled poor who were able-bodied were to be sent
to their homes. Able-bodied settled poor who knew no craft were
to be put on some public work&mdash;the undeserving being set to hard
labour. For others work was to be found, or they were to be assisted
to become self-supporting. The hospitals provided with medical
advice and necessaries were to be classified to meet the needs of the
sick, the blind and lunatics. The poor living at home were to work
with a view to their self-support. What they earned, if insufficient,
might be supplemented. If a citizen found a case of distress he was
not to help it, but to send it for inquiry to the magistrate. Children
were to be taught. Private relief was to be obtained from the rich.
The funds of endowed charities were to be the chief source of income;
if more was wanted, bequests and church collections would suffice.
The scheme was put in force in Yprès in 1524. The Sorbonne
approved it, and similar plans were adopted in Paris and elsewhere.
It is in outline the scheme of London municipal charity promoted
by Edward VI., by which the poor were classified, St Bartholomew&rsquo;s
and St Thomas&rsquo;s hospitals appropriated for the sick, Christ&rsquo;s hospital
for the children of the poor, and Bridewell for the correction of the
able-bodied. Less the institutional arrangements and plus the
compulsory rate, the methods are those of the Poor Relief Act of
Queen Elizabeth of 1601. At first the attempt had been made to
introduce state relief in reliance on voluntary alms (1 Mary 13,
5 Eliz. 3, 1562-1563), subject to the right of assessment if alms were
refused. But the position was anomalous. Charity is voluntary,
and spontaneously meets the demands of distress. Such demands
have always a tendency to increase with the supply. Hence the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page881" id="page881"></a>881</span>
limitations of charitable finance are in the nature of a safeguard.
At most economic trouble can only be assuaged by relief, and it can
only be met or prevented by economic and social reforms. If a
compulsory rate be not enforced, as in Scotland and formerly in
some parishes in England, a voluntary rate may be made in supplementation
of the local charities. In Scotland, where the compulsory
clauses of the Poor Relief Act of James I. were not put in force, the
country weathered the storm without them, and the compulsory
rate, which was extended throughout the country by the Poor Act of
1844, came in very slowly in the 18th and 19th centuries. In
France (1566) a similar act was passed and set aside. If a compulsory
rate be enforced, it is inevitable that the resources of charity,
unless kept apart from the poor-law and administered on different
lines from it, will diminish, and at the same time, as has happened
often in the case of endowed charities, the interest in charitable
administration will lapse, while the charges for poor-law relief,
drawn without much scruple from the taxation of the community,
will mount to millions either to meet increasing demands or to provide
more elaborate institutional accommodation. The principle
once adopted, it was enacted (1572-1573) that the aged and infirm
should be cared for by the overseers of the poor, a new authority;
and in 1601 the duplicate acts were passed, that for the relief of
the poor (43 Eliz. 2), and that for the furtherance and protection
of endowed charities. Thus the poor were brought into the dependence
of a legally recognized class, endowed with a claim for relief,
on the fulfilment of which, after a time, they could without difficulty
insist if they were so minded. The civic authority had indeed taken
over the alms of the parish, and an <i>eleemosyna civica</i> had taken the
place of the <i>annona civica</i>. It was a similar system under a different
name.</p>
</div>

<p>A phrase of Robert Cecil&rsquo;s (1st earl of Salisbury) indicates the
minute domestic character of the Elizabethan legislation (D&rsquo;Ewes,
674). The question (1601) was the repeal of a statute
of tillage. Cecil says: &ldquo;If in Edward I.&rsquo;s time a
<span class="sidenote">Poor Relief Acts and statutory serfdom.</span>
law was made for the maintenance of the fry of fish,
and in Henry VII.&rsquo;s for the preservation of the eggs
of wild fowl, shall we now throw away a law of more
consequence and import? If we debar tillage, we give scope
to the depopulating. And then, if the poor being thrust out of
their houses go to dwell with others, straight we catch them
with the statute of inmates; if they wander abroad, they are
within the danger of the statute of the poor to be whipt. So by
this undo this statute, and you endanger many thousands.&rdquo;
A strong central government, a local authority appointed directly
by the government, and a network of legislation controlled the
whole movement of economic life. On this reliance was placed
to meet economic difficulties. The local authorities were the
justices of the peace; and they had to carry out the statutes
for this purpose, to assess the wages of artisans and labourers,
and to enforce the payment of the wages they had fixed; to
ensure that suitable provision was made for the relief of the poor
at the expense of rates which they also fixed; and to suppress
vagabondage. Since 23 Edw. III. there had been labour statutes,
and in 1563 a new statute was passed, an &ldquo;Act containing divers
orders for Artificers, Labourers, Servants of Husbandry and
Apprentices&rdquo; (5 Eliz. c. 4). It recognized and upheld a social
classification. On the one hand there was the gentleman or
owner of property to which the act was not to apply; and on
the other the artisan and labouring class. This class in turn was
subdivided, and the justices were to assess their wages annually
according to &ldquo;the plenty and scarcity of the time and other
circumstances.&rdquo; Persons between the ages of twelve and sixty,
who were not apprentices or engaged in certain specified employments,
were compelled to serve in husbandry by the year &ldquo;with
any person that keepeth husbandry.&rdquo; The length of the day&rsquo;s
work and the conditions of apprenticeship were fixed. The
assessed rate of wages was enforceable by fine and imprisonment,
and refusal to be apprenticed by imprisonment. Thus there
was created a life control over labour with an industrial settlement
and a wage fixed by the justices annually. There are
differences of opinion in regard to the extent to which this act
was enforced; and the evidence on the point is comparatively
scanty. It was enforced throughout the century in which it
was passed, and it probably continued in force generally until
the Restoration, while subsequently it was put in operation to
meet special emergencies, such as times of distress when some
settlement of wages seemed desirable (cf. Rogers, v. 611;
Hewins, <i>English Trade and Finance</i>, p. 82; Cunningham, <i>Growth
of English Industry and Commerce: Modern Times</i>, i. 168). It
was not repealed till 1814.</p>

<p>From 1585 to 1622 there was, it is said, a slight increase in
labourers&rsquo; wages, which fluctuated from 5s. <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span>d. to 5s. 8 ¼d. a
week, with a declining standard of comfort and at times great
distress. Then there was a marked increase of wage till 1662
and &ldquo;a very marked improvement; the rate of increase being
very nearly double that of the earlier periods,&rdquo; and reaching
9s., &ldquo;as the highest weekly rate for the whole period.&rdquo; Then
from 1662 to 1702 there was &ldquo;a slight improvement&rdquo; (Hewins,
p. 89). It would seem indeed that the stir of the times between
1622 and 1662 may have caused a great demand for labour.
But with the Restoration, when the assessment system was
falling into desuetude, came the Poor Relief Act of 1662 (13 &amp;
14 Car. II. cap. 62), which brought in the law of settlement, and
a settlement for relief of a very strict nature was added to the
industrial settlement of the Artificers and Labourers Act. Thus,
if the influence of that act, which had so long controlled labour,
was waning, its place was now taken by an act which, though it
had nothing to do with the assessment of wage, yet so settled the
labourer within the bounds of his parish that he had practically
to rely, if not upon a wage fixed by the justices, yet upon a
customary wage limited and restricted as a result of the law of
settlement. And the assessment by the justices, in so far as it
may have continued, would therefore be of little or no consequence.
Settlement also, like the Artificers and Labourers Act,
would prevent the country labourer from passing to the towns,
or the townsmen passing to other towns. At least they would
do so at the risk of forfeiting their right to relief if they lost their
settlement without acquiring a new one. Hence the industrial
control, though under another name and other conditions,
remained in force to a large extent in practice.</p>

<p>By the Artificers and Labourers Act then, in conjunction with
other measures, the labouring classes were finally committed to
a new bondage, when they had freed themselves from the serfdom
of feudalism, and when the control exercised over them by the
gild and municipality was relaxed. The statute was so enforced
that to earn a year&rsquo;s livelihood would have taken a labourer not
52 weeks, but sometimes two years, or 58 weeks, or 80 weeks,
or 72 weeks; sometimes, however, less&mdash;48 or 35. It followed
that on such a system the country could only with the utmost
good fortune free itself from the economic difficulties of the
century, and that the need of a poor-law was felt the more as
these difficulties persisted. A voluntary or a municipal system
could not suffice, even as a palliative, while such statutes as
these were in force to render labour immobile and unprogressive.
Also, while wages were fixed by statute or order, whether chiefly
in the interest of the employers or not, obviously any shortage
on the wages had to be made good by the community. The
community, by fixing the wages to be earned in a livelihood,
made itself responsible for their sufficiency. And it is suggestive
to find that in the year in which the Artificers and Labourers Act
(1563) was passed, the act for the enforcement of assessments
of poor-rate (5 Eliz. cap. 3) was also enacted. The Law of
Settlement, to which we have referred, passed in the reign of
Charles II., was due, it is said, to a migration of labourers
southward from counties where less favourable statutory wages
prevailed; but it was, in fact, only a corollary of the Artificers
and Labourers Act of 1563 and the Poor Relief Act of 1601.
These laws, it may be said, were the means of making the English
labourer, until the poor-law reform of 1834, a settled but landless
serf, supported by a fixed wage and a state bounty. By the poor-law
it was possible to continue this state of things till, in consequence
of an absolute economic breakdown, there was no
alternative but reform.</p>

<p>The philanthropic nature of the poor-law is indicated by its
antecedents: once enacted, its bounties became a right; its
philanthropy disappeared in a quasi-legal claim. Its object was
to relieve the poor by home industries, apprentice children, and
provide necessary relief to the poor unable to work. The act was
commonly interpreted so as to include the whole of that indefinite
class, the &ldquo;poor&rdquo;; by a better and more rigid interpretation it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page882" id="page882"></a>882</span>
was, at least in the 19th century, held to apply only to the &ldquo;destitute,&rdquo;
that is, to those who required &ldquo;necessary relief&rdquo;&mdash;according
to the actual wording of the statute. The economic fallacy
of home industries founded on rate-supplied capital early declared
itself, and the method could only have continued as long as it did
because it formed part of a general system of industrial control.
When in the 18th century workhouses were established, the same
industrial fallacy, as records show, repeated itself under new
conditions. Within the parish it resulted in the farmer paying
the labourer as small a wage as possible, and leaving the parish
to provide whatever he might require in addition during his
working life and in his old age. Thus, indeed, a gigantic experiment
in civic employment was made for at least two centuries on
a vast scale throughout the country&mdash;and failed. As was natural,
the lack of economic independence reacted on the morals of
the people. With pauperism came want of energy, idleness and
a disregard for chastity and the obligations of marriage. The law,
it is true, recognized the mutual obligations of parents and
grandparents, children and grandchildren; but in the general poverty
which it was itself a means of perpetuating such obligations
became practically obsolete, while at all times they are difficult
to enforce. Still, the fact that they were recognized implies a
great advance in charitable thought. The act, passed at first
from year to year, was very slowly put in force. Even before it
was passed the poor-rate first assessed under the act of 1563 was
felt to be &ldquo;a greater tax than some subsidies,&rdquo; and in the time
of Charles II. it amounted to a third of the revenue of England
and Wales (Rogers, v. 81).</p>

<p>The service of villein and cottar was, as we have now seen, in
part superseded by what we have called a statutory wage-control,
founded on a basis of wage supplemented by relief, provided by a
rate-supported poor-law. But it follows that with the decay of
this system the poor-law itself should have disappeared, or
should have taken some new and very limited form. Unfortunately,
as in Roman times, state relief proved to be a popular and
vigorous parasite that outlived the tree on which it was rooted:
assessments of wage under the Statute of Labourers fell into
disuse after the Restoration, it is said, and the statute was
finally repealed in 1814, and sixty years later the act against
illegal combinations of working men; but the serfdom of the
poor-law, the <i>eleemosyna civica</i>, remained, to work the gravest
evil to the labouring classes, and even after the reform of 1834
greatly impeded the recovery of their independence. Nevertheless,
by a new law of state alms for the aged, or by statutory
outdoor relief with, as some would wish, a regulated wage, it is
now proposed to bring them once again under a thraldom similar
to that from which they have so slowly emancipated themselves.</p>

<p>The policy adopted by Queen Elizabeth for the relief of the
poor (1601) included a scheme for the reorganization of voluntary
charity as well as plans for the extension of rate-aided
relief. During the century, as we have seen, endeavours
<span class="sidenote">The endowed charities.</span>
had been made to create a system of voluntary charity.
This it was proposed to safeguard and promote concurrently
with the extension of the poor-rate. Accordingly, in
the poor-law it was arranged that the overseers, the new civic
authority, and the churchwardens, the old parochial and charitable
authority, should act in conjunction, and, subject to magisterial
approval, together &ldquo;raise weekly or otherwise&rdquo; the
necessary means &ldquo;by taxation of every inhabitant.&rdquo; The old
charitable organization was based on endowment, and the
churchwarden was responsible for the administration of many such
endowments. What was not available from these and other
sources was to be raised &ldquo;by taxation.&rdquo; The object of the new
act was to encourage charitable gifts.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 18th century, when the administration
of poor relief fell into confusion, many charities were lost, or were
in danger of being lost, and many were mismanaged. In 1786
and 1788 a committee of the House of Commons reported on the
subject. In 1818, chiefly through the instrumentality of Lord
Brougham, a commission of inquiry on educational charities was
appointed, and in 1819 another commission to investigate (with
some exceptions) all the charities for the poor in England and
Wales. These and subsequent commissions continued their
inquiries till 1835, when a select committee of the House of
Commons made a strong report, advocating the establishment
of a permanent and independent board, to inquire, to compel
the production of accounts, to secure the safe custody of charity
property, to adapt it to new uses on cy-près lines, &amp;c. A commission
followed in 1849, and eventually in 1853 the first
Charitable Trusts Act was passed, under which &ldquo;The Charity
Commissioners of England and Wales&rdquo; were appointed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The following are details of importance:&mdash;(1) <i>Definition.</i>&mdash;The
definition of the act of 1601 (Charitable Uses, 43 Eliz. 4) still holds
good. It enumerates as charitable objects all that was once called
&ldquo;alms&rdquo;: (a) &ldquo;The relief of aged, impotent and poor people&rdquo;&mdash;the
normal poor; &ldquo;the maintenance of sick and maimed soldiers
and mariners&rdquo;&mdash;the poor chiefly by reason of war, sometime a class
of privileged mendicants; (b) education, &ldquo;schools of learning, free
schools and scholars in universities&rdquo;; and then (c) a group of
objects which include general civic and religious purposes, and the
charities of gilds and corporations; &ldquo;the repair of bridges, ports,
havens, causeways, churches, sea-banks and highways; the education
and preferment of orphans; the relief, stock, or maintenance for
houses of correction; marriages of poor maids, supportation, aid,
and help of young tradesmen, handicraftsmen, and persons decayed&rdquo;;
and there follows (d) &ldquo;the relief or redemption of prisoners
or captives&rdquo;; and, lastly, (e) &ldquo;the aid and ease of any poor
inhabitants concerning payment of fifteens&rdquo; (the property-tax of Tudor
times), setting out of soldiers, and other taxes. The definition might
be illustrated by the charitable bequests of the next 60, or indeed
225, years. It is a fair summary of them. (2) <i>Charitable Gifts.</i>&mdash;A
public trust and a charitable trust are, as this definition shows,
synonymous. It is a trust which relates to public charities, and
is not held for the benefit of private persons, <i>e.g.</i> relations, but for
the common good, and, subject to the instructions of the founder,
by trustees responsible to the community. Gifts for charitable
purposes, other than those affected by the law of mortmain, have
always been viewed with favour. &ldquo;Where a charitable bequest is
capable of two constructions, one of which would make it void and
the other would make it effectual, the latter will be adopted by the
court&rdquo; (Tudor&rsquo;s <i>Charitable Trusts</i>, ed. 1906, by Bristowe, Hunt and
Burdett, p. 167). Gifts to the poor, or widows, or orphans, indefinitely,
or in a particular parish, were valid under the act, or for
any purpose or institution for the aid of the &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; Thus practically
the act covered the same field as the poor-law, though afterwards
it was decided that, &ldquo;as a rule, persons receiving parochial
relief were not entitled to the benefit of a charity intended for the
poor&rdquo; (Tudor, p. 167). (3) <i>Religious Differences.</i>&mdash;In the
administration of charities which are for the poor the broadest view is
taken of religious differences. (4) <i>Superstitious Uses.</i>&mdash;The
superstitious use is one that has for its object the propagation of the
rights of a religion not tolerated by the law (Tudor, p. 4). Consequently,
so far as charities were held or left subject to such rights, they
were illegal, or became legal only as toleration was extended. Thus
by degrees, since the Toleration Act of 1688, all charities to
dissenters have become legal&mdash;that is, trusts for schools, places for
religious instruction, education and charitable purposes generally. But
bequests for masses for the soul of the donor, or for monastic orders,
are still void. (5) <i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The duty of administering
charitable trusts falls upon trustees or corporations, and under the
term &ldquo;eleemosynary corporations&rdquo; are included endowed hospitals
and colleges. Under schemes of the Charity Commissioners, where
charities have been remodelled, besides trustees elected by corporations,
there are now usually appointed <i>ex-officio</i> trustees who represent
some office or institution of importance in connexion with the
charity. (6) <i>Jurisdiction by Chancery and Charity Commission.</i>&mdash;The
Court of Chancery has jurisdiction over charities, under the old
principle that &ldquo;charities are trusts of a public nature, in regard to
which no one is entitled by an immediate and peculiar interest to
prefer a complaint for compelling the performance by the trustees
of their obligations.&rdquo; The court, accordingly, represents the crown
as <i>parens patriae</i>. Now, by the Charitable Trusts Act 1853, and
subsequent acts, a charity commission has been formed which is
entrusted with large powers, formerly enforced only by the Court
of Chancery. (7) <i>Jurisdiction by Visitor.</i>&mdash;A further jurisdiction
is by the &ldquo;visitor,&rdquo; a right inherent in the founder of any eleemosynary
corporation, and his heirs, or those whom he appoints, or in
their default, the king. The object of the visitor is &ldquo;to prevent all
perverting of the charity, or to compose differences among members
of the corporation.&rdquo; Formerly the bishop&rsquo;s ordinary was the
recognized visitor (2 Henry V. I, 1414) of hospitals, apart from the
founder. Subsequently his power was limited (14 Eliz. c. 5, 1572)
to hospitals for which the founders had appointed no visitors.
Then (1601) by the Charitable Uses Act commissions were issued
for inquiry by county juries. Now, apart from the duty of visitors,
inquiry is conducted by the charity commissioners and the assistant
commissioners. By subsequent acts (see below) ecclesiastical and
eleemosynary charities have been still further separated and defined.
(8) <i>Advice.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Trustees, or other persons concerned in the management
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page883" id="page883"></a>883</span>
of a charity, may apply to the charity commissioners for their
opinion, advice or direction; and any person acting under such
advice is indemnified, unless he has been guilty of misrepresentation
in obtaining it.&rdquo; (9) <i>Limitation of Charity Commissioners&rsquo; Powers,</i>&mdash;The
commissioners cannot, however, make any order with respect
to any charity of which the gross annual income amounts to £50 or
upwards, except on the application (in writing) of the trustees or a
majority of them. Their powers are thus very limited, except when
put in motion by the trustees. If a parish is divided they can
apportion the charities if the gross income does not exceed £20.
(10) <i>General Powers of the Charity Commission.</i>&mdash;Subject to the
limitation of £50, &amp;c., the charity commissioners have power (Charitable
Trusts Act 1860) to make orders for the appointment or
removal of trustees, or of any officer, and for the transfer, payment
and vesting of any real or personal estate, or &ldquo;for the establishment
of any scheme for the administration&rdquo; of the charity, (11) <i>Schemes
and Remodelling of Charities.</i>&mdash;Under this power charities are remodelled,
and small and miscellaneous charities put into one fund
and applied to new purposes. The cy-près doctrine is applied, by
which if a testator leaves directions that are only indefinite, or if the
objects for which a charity was founded are obsolete, the charity is
applied to some purpose, as far as possible, in accordance with
the charitable intention of the founder. This doctrine probably
received its widest application in the City of London Parochial
Charities Act of 1883. Under other acts doles have been applied to
education and to allotments. About 380 schemes are issued in the
course of a year. (12) <i>Objects adopted in remodelling Charities.</i>&mdash;In
the remodelling of charities for the general benefit of the poor
some one or more of thirteen objects are usually included in the
scheme. These are subscriptions to a medical charity, to a provident
club or coal or clothing society, to a friendly society; for nurses, for
annuities, for outfit for service, &amp;c.; for emigration; for recreation
grounds, clubs, reading-rooms, museums, lectures; for temporary
relief to a limited amount in each year; for clothes fuel, tools,
medical aid, food, &amp;c., or in money &ldquo;in cases of unexpected loss or
sudden destitution&rdquo;; for pensions. (13) <i>Parochial Charities.</i>&mdash;By
the Local Government Act of 1892, local ecclesiastical charities, <i>i.e.</i>
endowments for &ldquo;any spiritual purpose that is a legal purpose&rdquo; (for
spiritual persons, church and other buildings, for spiritual uses, &amp;c.),
are separated from parochial charities, &ldquo;the benefits of which are,
or the separate distribution of the benefits of which is, confined to
inhabitants of a single parish, or of a single ancient ecclesiastical
parish, or not more than five neighbouring parishes.&rdquo; These
charities, since the Local Government Act 1894, are under the
supervision of the parish councils, who appoint trustees for their
management in lieu of the former overseer or vestry trustees, or,
under certain conditions, &ldquo;additional trustees.&rdquo; The accounts
have to be submitted to the parish meeting, and the names of the
beneficiaries of dole charities published. (14) <i>Official Trustees.</i>&mdash;There
is also &ldquo;an official trustee of charity lands,&rdquo; who as &ldquo;bare
trustee&rdquo; may hold the land or stock of the charity managed by
the trustees or administrators. In 1905 the stock transferred to
the official trustees amounted to £24,820,945. (15) <i>Audit</i>.&mdash;The
charity commissioners have no power of audit, but the trustees
of every charity have to prepare a statement of accounts annually,
and transmit it to the commission. The accounts have to be &ldquo;certified
under the hand of one or more of the trustees and by the auditor
of the charity.&rdquo; (16) <i>Taxation</i>.&mdash;In the case of rents and profits of
lands, &amp;c., belonging to hospitals or almshouses, or vested in trustees
for charitable purposes, allowances are made in diminution of income-tax
(56 Vict. 35 § 61). From the inhabited house duty any hospital
charity school, or house provided for the reception or relief of
poor persons, is exempted (House Tax Act 1808). Also there is an
exemption from the land-tax in regard to land rents, &amp;c., in possession
of hospitals before 1693. (17) <i>The Digest.</i>&mdash;A digest of
endowed charities in England and Wales was compiled in the years
1861 to 1876. A new digest of reports and financial particulars
has since been completed.</p>

<p>The income of endowed charities in 1876 was returned at £2,198,463.
It is now, no doubt, considerably larger than it was in 1876. Partial
returns show that at least a million a year is now available in England
and Wales for the assistance of the aged poor and for doles. Between
the poor-law, which, as it is at present administered, is a permanent
endowment provided from the rates for the support of a class of
permanent &ldquo;poor,&rdquo; and endowed charities, which are funds available
for the poor of successive generations, there is no great difference.
But in their resources and administration the difference is marked.
Local endowed charities were constantly founded after Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time till about 1830, and the poor-rate was at first supplementary
of the local charities. When corn and fuel were dear and
clothes very expensive, what now seem trivial endowments for food,
fuel, coal and clothes were important assets in the thrifty management
of a parish. But when the poor were recognized as a class of
dependants entitled by law to relief from the community, the rate
increased out of all proportion to the charities. A distinction then
made itself felt between the &ldquo;parish&rdquo; poor and the &ldquo;second&rdquo;
poor, or the poor who were not relieved from the rates, and relief
from the rates altogether overshadowed the charitable aid. Charitable
endowments were ignored, ill-administered, and often were
lost. After 1834 the poor-law was brought under the control of the
central government. Poor relief was placed in the hands of boards
of guardians in unions of parishes. The method of co-operation
between poor-law and charity suggested by the acts of Queen
Elizabeth was set aside, and, as a responsible partner in the public
work of relief, charity was disestablished. In the parishes the
endowed charities remained in general a disorganized medley of
separate trusts, jealously guarded by incompetent administrators.
To give unity to this mass of units, so long as the principles of charity
are misunderstood or ignored, has proved an almost impossible and
certainly an unpopular task. So far as it has been achieved, it has
been accomplished by the piecemeal legislation of schemes cautiously
elaborated to meet local prejudices. Active reform has been resented,
and politicians have often accentuated this resentment. In 1894 a
select committee was appointed to inquire whether it was desirable
to take measures to bring the action of the Charity Commission
more directly under the control of parliament, but no serious grievances
were substantiated. The committees&rsquo; reports are of interest,
however, as an indication of the initial difficulties of all charitable
work, the general ignorance that prevails in regard to the elementary
conditions that govern it, the common disregard of these principles,
and the absence of any accepted theory or constructive policy that
should regulate its development and its administration.</p>
</div>

<p>After the Poor-Law Act of 1601 the history of the voluntary
parochial charities in a town parish is marked by their decreasing
amount and utility, as poor-law relief and pauperism
increased. The act, it would seem, was not adopted
<span class="sidenote">Charity in the parish after 1601.</span>
with much alacrity by the local authorities. From
1625 to 1646 there were many years of plague and
sickness, but in St Giles&rsquo;s, London, as late as 1649, the amount
raised by the &ldquo;collectors&rdquo; (or overseers) was only £176. They
disbursed this to &ldquo;the visited poor&rdquo; as &ldquo;pensions.&rdquo; In 1665
an extra levy of £600 is mentioned. In the accounts of St
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields, where, as in St Giles&rsquo;s, gifts were received,
the change wrought by another half-century (1714) is apparent.
The sources of charitable relief are similar to those in all the
Protestant churches&mdash;English, Scottish or continental: church
collections and offertories; correctional fines, such as composition
for bastards and conviction money for swearers; and
besides these, income from annuities and legacies, the parish
estate, the royal bounty, and &ldquo;petitions to persons of quality.&rdquo;
In all £2041 was collected, but, so far as relief was concerned,
the parish relied not on it, but on the poor-rate, which produced
£3765. All this was collected and disbursed on their own
authority by collectors, to orphans, &ldquo;pensioners&rdquo; or the &ldquo;known
or standing&rdquo; poor, or to casual poor (£1818), including nurse
children and bastards. The begging poor were numerous and
the infant death-rate enormous, and each year three-fourths
of those christened were &ldquo;inhumanly suffered to die by the
barbarity of nurses.&rdquo; The whole administration was uncharitable,
injurious to the community and the family, and inhuman
to the child. If one may judge from later accounts of other
parishes even up to 1834, usually it remained the same, purposeless
and unintelligent; and it can hardly be denied that, generally
speaking, only since the middle of the 19th century has any
serious attention been paid to the charitable side of parochial
work. Parallel to the parochial movement of the poor-law in
England, in France (about 1617) were established the <i>bureaux
de bienfaisance</i>, at first entirely voluntary institutions, then
recognized by the state, and during the Revolution made the
central administration for relief in the communes.</p>

<p>In the 17th century in England, as in France, opinion favoured
the establishment of large hospitals or <i>maisons Dieu</i> for the
reception of the poor of different classes. In France
throughout the century there was a continuous struggle
<span class="sidenote">Charitable movements after 1601.</span>
with mendicancy, and the hospitals were used as
places into which offenders were summarily driven.
A new humanity was, however, beginning its protest. The pitiful
condition of abandoned children attracted sympathy in both
countries. St Vincent de Paul established homes for the <i>enfants
trouvés</i>, followed in England by the establishment of the Foundling
hospital (1739). In both countries the method was applied
inconsiderately and pushed to excess, and it affected family
life most injuriously. Grants from parliament supported the
foundling movement in England, and homes were opened in
many parts of the country. The demand soon became overwhelming;
the mortality was enormous, and the cost so large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page884" id="page884"></a>884</span>
that it outstripped all financial expedients. The lesson of the
experiment is the same as that of the poor-law catastrophe
before 1834; only, instead of the able-bodied poor of another
age, infants were made the object of a compassionate but
undiscerning philanthropy. With widespread relief there came
widespread abandonment of duty and economic bankruptcy.
Had the poor-rates instead of charitable relief been used in the
same way, the moral injury would have been as great, but the
annual draft from the rates would have concealed the moral
and postponed the economic disaster. To amend the evil, changes
were made by which the relation between child and mother was
kept alive, and a personal application on her part was required;
the character of the mother and her circumstances were investigated,
and assistance was only given when it would be &ldquo;the
means of replacing the mother in the course of virtue and the
way of an honest livelihood.&rdquo; General reforms were also made,
especially through the instrumentality of Jonas Hanway, to
check infant mortality, and metropolitan parishes were required
to provide for their children outside London. A kindred movement
led to the establishment of penitentiaries (1758), of lock
hospitals and lying-in hospitals (1749-1752).</p>

<p>In Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign there was a new educational movement,
&ldquo;the charity school&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to teach poor children the alphabet
and the principles of religion,&rdquo; followed by the Sunday-school
movement (1780), and about the same time (1788) by &ldquo;the
school of industry&rdquo;&mdash;to employ children and teach them to be
industrious. In 1844 the Ragged School Union was established,
and until the Education Act of 1870 continued its voluntary
educational work. As an outcome of these movements,
through the efforts of Miss Mary Carpenter and many others,
in 1854-1855 industrial and reformatory schools were established,
to prevent crime and reform child criminals. The orphanage
movement, beginning in 1758, when the Orphan Working Home
was established, has been continued to the present day on a vastly
extended scale. In 1772 a society for the discharge of persons
imprisoned for small debts was established, and in 1773 Howard
began his prison reforms. This raised the standard of work in
institutional charities generally. After the civil wars the old
hospital foundations of St Bartholomew and St Thomas, municipalized
by Edward VI., became endowed charities partly supported
by voluntary contributions. The same fate befell Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital, in connexion with which the voting system, the admission
of candidates by the vote of the whole body of subscribers&mdash;that
peculiarly English invention&mdash;first makes its appearance.</p>

<p>A new interest in hospitals sprang up at the end of the 17th
century. St Thomas&rsquo;s was rebuilt (1693) and St Bartholomew&rsquo;s
(1739); Guy&rsquo;s was founded in 1724, and on the system of free
&ldquo;letters&rdquo; obtainable in exchange for donations, voluntary
hospitals and infirmaries were established in London (1733 and
later) and in most of the large towns. Towards the end of
the 18th century the dispensary movement was developed&mdash;a
system of local dispensaries with fairly definite districts and home
visiting, a substitute for attendance at a hospital, where &ldquo;hospital
fever&rdquo; was dreaded, and an alternative to what was then
a very ill-administered system of poor-law medical relief. After
1840 the provident dispensary was introduced, in order that the
patients by small contributions in the time of health might
provide for illness without having to meet large doctors&rsquo; bills,
and the doctor might receive some sufficient remuneration for
his attendance on poor patients. This movement was largely
extended after 1860. Three hospital funds for collecting contributions
for hospitals and making them grants, a movement
that originated in Birmingham in 1859, were established in
London in 1873 and 1897.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Since 1868 the poor-law medical system of Great Britain has been
immensely improved and extended, while at the same time the
number of persons in receipt of free medical relief in most of the large
towns has greatly increased. The following figures refer to London:
at hospitals, 97 in number, in-patients (1904) during the year,
118,536; out-patients and casualty cases, 1,858,800; patients at
free, part-pay, or provident dispensaries, about 280,000; orders
issued for attendance at poor-law dispensaries and at home, 114,158.
The number of beds in poor-law infirmaries (1904) was 16,976.
There are in London 12 general hospitals with, 18 without, medical
schools, and 67 special hospitals. Thus the population in receipt
of public and voluntary medical relief is very large, indeed altogether
excessive.</p>
</div>

<p>Each religious movement has brought with it its several
charities. The Society of Friends, the Wesleyans, the Baptists
have large charities. With the extension of the High Church
movement there have been established many sisterhoods which
support penitentiaries, convalescent homes and hospitals, schools,
missions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The magnitude of this accumulating provision of charitable relief
is evident, though it cannot be summed up in any single total.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 19th century anti-mendicity societies
were established; and later, about 1869, in England and Scotland
a movement began for the organization of charitable relief,
in connexion with which there are now societies and committees
in most of the larger towns in Great Britain, in the colonies, and
in the United States of America. More recently the movement
for the establishment of settlements in poor districts, initiated
by Canon Barnett at Toynbee Hall&mdash;&ldquo;to educate citizens in the
knowledge of one another, and to provide them with teaching and
recreation&rdquo;&mdash;has spread to many towns in England and America.</p>

<p>These notes of charitable movements suggest an altogether
new development of thought. On behalf of the charity school
of Queen Anne&rsquo;s time were preached very formal
sermons, which showed but little sympathy with child
<span class="sidenote">Progress of thought in 18th and 19th centuries.</span>
life. After the first half of the century a new humanism
with which we connect the name of Rousseau, slowly
superseded this formal beneficence. Rousseau made
the world open its eyes and see nature in the child,
the family and the community. He analysed social life, intent
on explaining it and discovering on what its well-being
depended; and he stimulated that desire to meet definite social
needs which is apparent in the charities of the century. Little
as it may appear to be so at first sight, it was a period of
charitable reformation. Law revised the religious conception
of charity, though he was himself so strangely devoid of social
instinct that, like some of his successors, he linked the utmost
earnestness in belief to that form of almsgiving which most
effectually fosters beggardom. Howard introduced the era of
inspection, the ardent apostle of a new social sagacity; and
Bentham, no less sagacious, propounded opinions, plans and
suggestions which, perhaps it may be said, in due course moulded
the principles and methods of the poor-law of 1834. In the
broader sense the turn of thought is religious, for while usually
stress is laid on the religious scepticism of the century, the
deeper, fervent, conscientious and evangelical charity in which
Nonconformists, and especially &ldquo;the Friends,&rdquo; took so large a
part, is often forgotten. Sometimes, indeed, as often happens
now, the feeling of charity passed into the merest sentimentality.
This is evident, for instance, from so ill-considered a measure as
Pitt&rsquo;s Bill for the relief of the poor. On the other hand, during
the 18th century the poor-law was the object of constant criticism,
though so long as the labour statutes and the old law of settlement
were in force, and the relief of the labouring population
as state &ldquo;poor&rdquo; prevailed, it was impossible to reform it.
Indeed, the criticism itself was generally vitiated by a tacit
acceptance of &ldquo;the poor&rdquo; as a class, a permanent and irrevocable
charge on the funds of the community; and at the end of the
18th century, when the labour statutes were abrogated, but
the conditions under which poor relief was administered remained
the same, serfdom in its later stage, the serfdom of the poor-law,
asserted itself in its extremest form in times of dearth and
difficulty during the Napoleonic War. In 1802-1803 it was
calculated (Marshall&rsquo;s <i>Digest</i>) that 28% of the population were
in receipt of permanent or occasional relief. Those in receipt
of the former numbered 734,817, including children&mdash;so real
had this serfdom of the poor become.</p>

<p>In 1832 the expenditure on pauperism in England and Wales
was £7,036,968. In the early years of the 19th century the
mendicity societies, established in some of the larger towns, were
a sign of the general discontent with existing methods of administration.
The Society for Bettering the Condition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page885" id="page885"></a>885</span>
Poor&mdash;representing a group of men such as Patrick Colquhoun,
Sir I. Bernard, Dr Lettsom, Dr Haygarth, James Neald, Count
Rumford and others&mdash;took a more positive line and issued
many useful publications (1796). After 1833 the very atmosphere
of thought seems changed. There was a general desire to be quit
of the serfdom of pauperism. The Poor-law Amendment Act
was passed in 1834, and since then male able-bodied pauperism
has dwindled to a minimum. The bad years of 1860-1870
revived the problem in England and Scotland, and the old spirit
of reform for a time prevailed. Improved administration working
with economic progress effected still further reductions of
pauperism, till on the 1st of January 1905 (exclusive of lunatics
in county asylums and casual paupers) the mean number of
paupers stood at 764,589, or 22.6 per thousand of the population,
instead of 41.8 per thousand as in 1859 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Poor-law</a></span>).</p>

<p>Charity organization societies were formed after 1869, with
the object of &ldquo;improving the condition of the poor,&rdquo; or, in other
words, to promote independence by an ordered and co-operative
charity; and the Association for Befriending Young Servants,
and workhouse aid committees, in order to prevent relapse into
pauperism on the part of those who as children or young women
received relief from the poor-law. The Local Government Board
adopted a restricted out-door relief policy, and a new interest
was felt in all the chief problems of local administration. The
movement was general. The results of the Elberfeld system
of municipal relief administered by unpaid almoners, each
dealing with but one or two cases, influenced thought both in
England and America. The experience gained by Mr Joseph
Tuckerman of Boston of the utility of registering applications
for relief, and the teaching of Miss Octavia Hill, led to the foundation
of the system of friendly visiting and associated charity at
Boston (1880) and elsewhere. Since that time the influence of
Arnold Toynbee and the investigations of Charles Booth have led
to a better appreciation of the conditions of labour; and to some
extent, in London and elsewhere, the spirit of charity has assumed
the form of a new devotion to the duties of citizenship. But
perhaps, in regard to charity in Great Britain, the most important
change has been the revival of the teaching of Dr Chalmers (1780-1847),
who (1819) introduced a system of parochial charity at
St John&rsquo;s, Glasgow, on independent lines, consistent with the best
traditions of the Scottish church. In the development of the
theory of charitable relief on the economic side this has been a
main factor. His view, which he tested by experience, may be
summed up as follows: Society is a growing, self-supporting
organism. It has within it, as between family and family,
neighbour and neighbour, master and employee, endless links of
sympathy and self-support. Poverty is not an absolute, but a
relative term. Naturally the members of one class help one
another; the poor help the poor. There is thus a large invisible
fund available and constantly used by those who, by their
proximity to one another, know best how to help. The philanthropist
is an alien to this life around him. Moved by a sense of
contrast between his own lot, as he understands it, and the lot of
those about him, whom he but little understands, he concludes
that he should relieve them. But his gift, unless it be given in
such a way as to promote this self-support, instead of weakening
it, is really injurious. In the first place, by his interference he
puts a check on the charitable resources of another class and
lessens their social energy. What he gives they do not give,
though they might do so. But next, he does more harm than this.
He stimulates expectation, so that by a false arithmetic his gift of
a few shillings seems to those who receive it and to those who
hear of it a possible source of help in any difficulty. To them it
represents a large command of means; and where one has
received what, though it be little, is yet, relative to wage, a large
sum to be acquired without labour, many will seek more, and
with that object will waste their time and be put off their work,
or even be tempted to lie and cheat. So social energy is diverted
from its proper use. Alms thus given weakens social ties,
diminishes the natural relief funds of mutual help, and beggars
a neighbour instead of benefiting him. By this argument a
clear and well-defined purpose is placed before charity. Charity
becomes a science based on social principles and observation.
Not to give alms, but to keep alive the saving health of the
family, becomes its problem: relief becomes altogether subordinate
to this, and institutions or societies are serviceable or the
reverse according as they serve or fail to serve this purpose.
Not poverty, but distress is the plea for help; not almsgiving,
but charity the means. To charity is given a definite social aim,
and a desire to use consistently with this aim every method that
increasing knowledge and trained ability can devise.</p>

<p>Under such influences as these, joined with better economic
conditions, a great reform has been made. The poor-law, however,
remains&mdash;the modern <i>eleemosyna civica</i>. It now, indeed,
absorbs a proportionately lesser amount of the largely increased
national income, but, excluding the maintenance of lunatics, it
costs Great Britain more than twelve millions a year; and among
the lower classes of the poor, directly or indirectly, it serves as a
bounty on dependence and is a permanent obstacle to thrift and
self-reliance. The number of those who are within the circle
of its more immediate attraction is now perhaps, in different
parts of the country or different districts in a town, not more
than, say, 20% of the population. Upon that population the
statistics of a day census would show a pauperism not of 2.63, the
percentage of the mean day pauperism on the population in 1908,
but of 13.15%; and the percentage would be much greater&mdash;twice
as large, perhaps&mdash;if the total number of those who in some
way received poor relief in the course of a year were taken into
account. The English poor-law is thus among the lower classes,
those most tempted to dependence&mdash;say some six or seven millions
of the people&mdash;a very potent influence definitely antagonistic
to the good development of family life, unless it be limited to very
narrow proportions; as, for instance, to restricted indoor or
institutional relief for the sick, for the aged and infirm, who in
extreme old age require special care and nursing, and for the
afflicted, for whom no sufficient charitable provision is procurable.
As ample experience shows, only on these conditions can poor-law
relief be justified from the point of view of charity and the
common good. In marked contrast to this opinion is the English
movement for Old Age pensions, which came to its first fruition in
1908&mdash;a huge charity started on the credit of the state, the
extension of which might ultimately involve a cost comparable
with that of the army or the navy. Schemes of the kind have
been adopted in the Australasian colonies with limitations and
safeguards; and they seem likely to develop into a new type of
poor-relief organization for the aged and infirm (Report: Royal
Commission on Old Age Pensions, Commonwealth of Australia,
1906). In England, partly to meet the demand for better state
provision for the aged, the Local Government Board in 1900 urged
the boards of guardians to give more adequate outdoor relief to
aged deserving people, and laid no stress on the test of destitution,
or, in other words, the limitation of relief to what was
actually &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo; the neglect of which has led to new difficulties.
History has proved that demoralization results from the
wholesale relief whether of the mass of the citizens, or of the
able-bodied, or of the children, and the proposal to limit the
endowment to the aged makes no substantial difference. The
social results must be similar; but social forces work slowly,
and usually only the unanswerable argument of financial bankruptcy
suffices to convert a people habituated to dependence,
though the inward decay of vitality and character may long
before be manifest. Ultimately the distribution of pensions by
way of out-door relief, corrupting a far more independent people,
is calculated to work a far greater injury than the <i>annona civica</i>.
Such an endowment of old age might indeed be justified as part of
a system of regulated labour, which, as in earlier times, could not
be enforced without some such extraneous help, but it could not
be justified otherwise. It is naturally associated, therefore, with
socialistic proposals for the regulation of wage.</p>

<p>In the light of the principles of charity, which we have considered
historically, we have now to turn to two questions:
charity and economics, and charity and socialism.</p>

<p>The object of charity is to render to our neighbour the services
and duties of goodwill, friendship and love. To prevent distress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page886" id="page886"></a>886</span>
charity has for its further object to preserve and develop the
manhood and womanhood of individuals and their self-maintenance
<span class="sidenote">The economics of charity.</span>
in and through the family; and any form of
state intervention is approved or disapproved by the
same standard. By self-maintenance is meant self-support
throughout life in its ordinary contingencies&mdash;sickness,
widowhood, old age, &amp;c. Political economy we
would define as the science of exchange and exchange value.
Here it has to be considered in relation to the purposes of charity.
By way of illustration we take, accordingly, three points:
distribution and use, supplementation of wage, and the standard
of well-being or comfort in relation to wage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) <i>Distribution and Use.</i>&mdash;Economy in the Greek sense begins at
this point&mdash;the administration and the use of means and resources.
Political economy generally ignores this part of the problem. Yet
from the point of view of charity it is cardinal to the whole issue.
The distribution of wage may or may not be largely influenced by
trades unions; but the variation of wage, as is generally the case,
by the increase or decrease of a few pence is of less importance than
its use. Comparing a careful and an unthrifty family, the difference
in use may amount to as much as a third on the total wage. Mere
abstention from alcohol may make, in a normal family, a difference
of 6s. in a wage of 25s. On the other hand, membership of a friendly
society is at a time of sickness equivalent to the command of a large
sum of money, for the common stock of capital is by that means
placed at the disposal of each individual who has a share in it.
Further, even a small amount saved may place the holder in a
position to get a better market for his labour; he can wait when
another man cannot. Rent may be high, but by co-operation that
too may be reduced. Other points are obvious and need not be
mentioned. It is evident that while the amount of wage is important,
still more important is its use. In use it has a large
expansive value. (2) <i>Supplementation of Wage.</i>&mdash;The exchange
between skill and wage must be free if it is to be valid. The less the
skill the greater is the temptation to philanthropists to supplement
the lesser wage; and the more important is non-supplementation,
for the skilled can usually look after their own interests in the
market, while the less skilled, because their labour is less marketable,
have to make the greater effort to avoid dependence. But the dole
of endowed charities, outdoor relief, and any constant giving, tend
to reduce wage, and thus to deprive the recipients of some part of the
means of independence. The employer is pressed by competition
himself, and in return he presses for profit through a reduced wage,
if circumstances make it possible for the workman to take it. And
thus a few individuals may lower the wages of a large class of poorly
skilled or unskilled hands. In these conditions unionism, even if it
were likely to be advantageous, is not feasible. Unionism can only
create a coherent unit of workers where there is a limited market
and a definite saleable skill. Except for the time, insufficient wage
will not be remedied in the individual case by supplementation in
any form&mdash;doles, clothes, or other kinds of relief; and in that case,
too, the relief will probably produce lessened energy after a short
time, or in other words lessened ability to live. An insufficient wage
may be prevented by increasing the skill of the worker, who will
then have the advantage of a better series of economic exchanges,
but hardly otherwise. If the supplementation be not immediate,
but postponed, as in the case of old-age pensions, its effect will be
similar. To the extent of the prospective adventitious gain the
attraction to the friendly society and to mutual help and saving will
grow less. Necessity has been the inventor of these; and where
wage is small, a little that would otherwise be saved is quickly spent
if the necessity for saving it is removed. Only necessity schools
most men, especially the weak, to whom it makes most difference
ultimately, whether they are thrifty or whether or not they save for
the future in any way. (3) <i>The Standard of Well-being or Comfort
in Relation to Wage.</i>&mdash;With an increase of income there has to be
an increase in the power to use income intelligently. Whatever is
not so used reacts on the family to its undoing. Constantly when
the wife can earn a few shillings a week, the husband will every week
idle for two or three days; so also if the husband finds that in a few
days he can earn enough to meet what he considers to be his requirements
for the week. In these circumstances the standard of well-being
falls below the standard of wage; the wage is in excess of the
energy and intelligence necessary to its economic use, and in these
cases ultimately pauperism often ensues. The family is demoralized.
Thus, with a view to the prevention of distress in good times, when
there is the less poverty there is the more need of charity, rightly
understood; for charity would strive to promote the right use of
wage, as the best means of preventing distress and preserving the
economic well-being of the family.</p>
</div>

<p>The theory of charity separates it entirely from socialism,
as that word is commonly used. Strictly socialism means, in
questions affecting the community, a dominant regard for the
common or social good in so far as it is contrary to private or
<span class="sidenote">Charity and socialism.</span>
individual advantage. But even so the antithesis is misleading,
for the two need not be inconsistent. On the contrary, the
common good is really and ultimately only individual good (not
advantage) harmonized to a common end. The issue,
indeed, is that of old Greek days, and the conditions
of a settlement of it are not substantially different.
Using modern terms one may say that charity is
&ldquo;interventionist.&rdquo; It has sought to transform the world by the
transformation of the will and the inward life in the individual
and in society. It would intensify the spirit and feeling of
membership in society and would aim at improving social conditions,
as science makes clear what the lines of reform should
be. So it has constantly intervened in all kinds of ways, and,
in the 19th century for instance, it has initiated many movements
afterwards taken up by public authorities&mdash;such as prison
reform, industrial schools, child protection, housing, food
reform, &amp;c., and it has been a friendly ally in many reforms that
affect industry very closely, as, for instance, in the introduction
of the factory acts. But it has never aimed at recasting society
itself on a new economic plan, as does socialism. Socialism
indeed offers the people a new state of social security. It
recognizes that the <i>annona civica</i> and the old poor-law may have
been bad, but it would meet the objection made against them by
insisting on the gradual creation of a new industrial society
in which wage would be regulated and all would be supported,
some by wage in adult life, some by allowance in old age, and
others by maintenance in childhood. Accordingly for it all
schemes for the state maintenance of school children, old age
pensions, or state provision for the unemployed are, like municipal
trading, steps towards a final stage, in which none shall want
because all shall be supported by society or be dependent on it
industrially. To charity this position seems to exclude the ethical
element in life and to treat the people primarily or chiefly as
human animals. It seems also to exclude the motives for energy
and endeavour that come from self-maintenance. Against it,
on the other hand, socialism would urge, that only by close
regulation and penalty will the lowest classes be improved, and
that only the society that maintains them can control them.
Charity from its experience doubts the possibility of such control
without a fatal loss of initiative on the part of those controlled,
and it believes both that there is constant improvement on the
present conditions of society and that there will be constantly
more as science grows and its conclusions are put in force.
Thus charity and socialism, in the usual meaning of the word,
imply ultimately two quite different theories of social life.
The one would re-found society industrially, the other would
develop it and allow it to develop.</p>

<p>The springs of charity lie in sympathy and religion, and, one
would now add, in science. To organize it is to give to it the
&ldquo;ordered nature&rdquo; of an organic whole, to give it a
definite social purpose, and to associate the members
<span class="sidenote">The organization of charity.</span>
of the community for the fulfilment of that purpose.
This in turn depends on the recognition of common
principles, the adoption of a common method, self-discipline
and training, and co-operation. In a mass of people there may
be a large variation in motives coincident with much unity in
action. Thus there may be acceptance of a common social
purpose in charity, while in one the impulse is similar to that
which moved St Francis or George Herbert, in another to that
which moved Howard or Dr Chalmers, or a modern poor-law
reformer like Sir G. Nicholls or E. Denison. Accepting, then,
the principles of charity, we pass to the method in relation to
assistance and relief. Details may vary, but on the following
points there is general agreement among students and workers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) <i>The Committee or Conference.</i>&mdash;There are usually two kinds
of local relief: the public or poor-law relief, and relief connected
with religious agencies. Besides, there is the relief of endowments,
societies and charitable persons. Therefore, as a condition precedent
to all organization, there must be some local centre of association
for information and common help. A town should be divided for
this purpose into manageable areas coincident with parishes or
poor-law divisions, or other districts. Subject to an acceptance of
general principles, those engaged in charity should be members of a
local conference or committee, or allied to it. The committee would
thus be the rallying-point of a large and somewhat loosely knit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page887" id="page887"></a>887</span>
association of friends and workers. (2) <i>Inquiry, Aid and Registration</i>.&mdash;The
object of inquiry is to ascertain the actual causes of distress
or dependence, and to carry on the work there must usually be a
staff of several honorary and one or two paid workers. Two methods
may be adopted: to inquire in regard to applications for help with
a view to forming some plan of material help or friendly aid, or both,
which will lead to the ultimate self-support of the family and its
members, and, under certain conditions, in the case of the aged or
sick, to their continuous or their sufficient help; or to ascertain
the facts partly at once, partly by degrees, and then to form and
carry out some plan of help, or continue to befriend the family in
need of help, in the hope of bringing them to conditions of self-support,
leaving the work of relief entirely to other agencies. The
committee in neither case should be a relief committee&mdash;itself a
direct source of relief. On the former method it has usually no relief
fund, but it raises from relations, employers, charities and charitable
persons the relief required, according to the plan of help agreed
upon, unless, indeed, it is better not to relieve the case, or to leave
it to the poor-law. The committee thus makes itself responsible
for endeavouring to the best of its ability to raise the necessary
relief, and acts as trustee for those who co-operate without it, in
such a way as to keep intact and to give play to all the natural
obligations that lie within the inner circles of a self-supporting
community. On the latter method the work of relief is left to general
charity, or to private persons, or to the poor-law; and the effort is
made to help the family to self-support by a friendly visitor. This
procedure is that adopted by the associated charities in Boston,
Mass., and other similar societies in America and elsewhere. It is
akin also to that adopted in the municipal system of relief in
Elberfeld&mdash;which has become with many variations in detail the standard
method of poor relief in Germany. The method of associated help,
combined with personal work, represents the usual practice of
charity organization societies. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the plan can be
adopted on the simplest scale in parochial or other relief committees,
subject to the safeguards of sufficient training and settled method.
The inquiry should cover the following points: names and address,
and ages of family, previous addresses, past employment and wages,
present income, rent and liabilities, membership of friendly or other
society, and savings, relations, relief (if any) from any source.
These points should be verified, and reference should be made to the
clergy, the poor-law authorities, and others, to ascertain if they
know the applicant. The result should be to show how the applicant
has been living, and what are the sources of possible help, and also
what is his character. The problem, however, is not whether the
person is &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; or &ldquo;undeserving,&rdquo; but whether, granted the
facts, the distress can be stayed and self-support attained. If the
help can be given privately from within the circle of the family, so
much the better. Often it may be best to advise, but not to interfere.
In some cases but little help may be necessary; in others
again the friendly relation between applicant and friend may last
for months and even years. Usually in charitable work the question
of the kind of relief available&mdash;money, tickets, clothes, &amp;c.&mdash;governs
the decision how the case should be assisted. But this is quite
wrong: the opposite is the true rule. The wants of the case, rightly
understood, should govern the decision as to what charity should
do and what it should provide. Cases are overwhelming in number,
as at the out-patient and casualty departments of a hospital, where
the admissions are made without inquiry, and subject practically
to no restrictions; but when there is inquiry, and each case is
seriously considered and aided with a view to self-support, the
numbers will seldom be overwhelming. On this plan appeal is made
to the strength of the applicant, and requires an effort on his part.
Indiscriminate relief, on the other hand, attracts the applicant by
an appeal to his weakness, and it requires of him no effort. Hence,
apart even from the differentiating effect of inquiry, one method
makes applicants, the other limits their number, although on the
latter plan much more strenuous endeavours be made to assist the
lesser number of claimants. For the routine work of the office an
extremely simple system of records with card index, &amp;c., has been
devised. In some cities, particularly in the United States of America,
there is a central registration of cases, notified by individual charities,
poor-relief authorities and private persons. The system of charity
organization or associated charity, it will be seen, allows of the
utmost variety of treatment, according to the difficulties in each
instance and the remedies available, and the utmost scope for personal
work. (3) <i>Training.</i>&mdash;If charitable work is an art, those who
undertake it must needs be trained both in practice and method
and in judgment. It requires, too, that self-discipline which blends
intelligence with emotion, and so endows emotion with strength
and purpose. In times of distress a reserve of trained workers is
of the utmost service. At all times they do more and produce,
socially, better results; but when there is general distress of any
kind they do not lose their heads like new recruits, but prevent
at least some of the mischief that comes of the panic which often
takes possession of a community, when distress is apprehended,
and leads to the wildest distribution of relief. Also trained workers
make the most useful poor-law guardians, trustees of charities,
secretaries of charitable societies and district visitors. All clergy
and ministers and all medical men who have to be engaged in the
administration of medical relief should learn the art of charity.
Poor-law guardians are usually elected on political or general grounds,
and have no special knowledge of good methods of charity; and
trustees are seldom appointed on the score of their qualifications
on this head. To provide the necessary education in charity there
should be competent helpers and teachers at charity organization
committees and elsewhere, and an alliance for this purpose should
be formed between them and professors and teachers of moral science
and economics and the &ldquo;settlements.&rdquo; Those who study social
problems in connexion with what a doctor would call &ldquo;cases&rdquo; or
&ldquo;practice&rdquo; see the limits and the falsity of schemes that on paper
seem logical enough. This puts a check on the influence of
scheme-building and that literary sensationalism which makes capital out
of social conditions. (4) <i>Co-operation.</i>&mdash;Organization in charity
depends on extensive co-operation, and ultimately on the acceptance
of common views. This comes but slowly. But with much tribulation
the goal may be reached, if in case after case the effort is made
to provide friendly help through charities and private persons,&mdash;unless,
as may well be, it should seem best not to interfere, but to
leave the applicant to apply to the administrators of public relief.
Experience of what is right and wrong in charity is thus gained on
both sides. Many sources may have to be utilized for aid of different
kinds even in a single case, and for the prevention of distress
co-operation with members of friendly societies and with co-operative
and thrift agencies is indispensable.</p>
</div>

<p>Where there is accord between charity and the poor-law pauperism
may be largely reduced. The poor-law in most countries has
at its disposal certain institutional relief and out-door
allowances, but it has no means of devising plans of
<span class="sidenote">The poor law.</span>
help which may prevent application to the rates or
&ldquo;take&rdquo; people &ldquo;off the rates.&rdquo; Thus a widow in the first days
of widowhood applies and receives an allowance according to
the number of her children. Helped at the outset by charity on
some definite plan, she may become self-supporting; and if her
family be large one or two of her children may be placed in schools
by the guardians, while she maintains the remaining children
and herself. As far as possible there should be a division of
labour between the poor-law and charity. Except where some
plan such as that just mentioned is adopted, one or the other
should take whole charge of the case relieved. There should be
no supplementation of poor-law relief by charity. This will
weaken the strength and dissipate the resources of charity without
adding to the efficiency of the poor-law. Unless the guardians
adopt a restrictive out-door relief policy, there is no scope for
any useful division of labour between them and charity; for the
many cases which, taken in time, charity might save from
pauperism, they will draw into chronic dependence by their
allowances a very much larger number. But if there is a
restrictive out-door policy, so far as relief is necessary, charity
may undertake to meet on its own lines distress which the poor-law
would otherwise have met by allowances, and, subject to
the assistance of urgent cases, poor-law relief may thus by
degrees become institutional only. Then, in the main, natural
social forces would come into play, and dependence on any form
of <i>annona civica</i> would cease.</p>

<p>Open-handed hospitality always creates mendicants. This is
what the hospitals offer in the out-patient and casualty
departments, and they have created a class of hospital
mendicants. The cases are quickly dealt with, without
<span class="sidenote">Hospitals.</span>
inquiry and without regard to home conditions. The medical
man in the hospital does not co-operate with any fellow-workers
outside the hospital. Where his physic or advice ceases to
operate his usefulness ceases. He regards no conditions of
morality. In a large number of cases drink or vice is the cause
of application, and the cure of the patient is dependent on moral
conditions; but he returns home, drinks and may beat his wife,
and then on another visit to the hospital he will again be
physicked and so on. The man is not even referred to the poor-law
infirmary for relief. Nor are conditions of home sanitation
regarded. One cause of constant sickness is thus entirely
overlooked, while drugs, otherwise unnecessary, are constantly
given at the hospital. The hospitals are thus large isolated
relief stations which are creating a new kind of pauperism.
So far as the patients can pay&mdash;and many can do so&mdash;the
general practitioners, to whom they would otherwise go, are
deprived of their gains. Still worse is it when the hospital itself
charges a fee in its out-patient department. The relief is then
claimed even more absolutely as a right, and the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page888" id="page888"></a>888</span>
practitioners are still further injured. The doctors, as a medical
staff, are not only medical men, but whether they recognize the fact
or not, they are also almsgivers or almoners; what they give is
relief. Yet few or none of them have ever been trained for that
work, and consequently they do not realize how very advantageous,
even for the cure of their own patients, would be a thorough
treatment of each case both at the hospital and outside it. Nor
can they understand how their methods at present protract
sickness and promote habitual dependence. Were this side of
their work studied by them in any way they would be the first,
probably, to press upon the governors of their hospitals the
necessity for a change. Unfortunately, at present the governors
are themselves untrained, and to finance the hospital and to
make it a good institution is their sole object. Hospitals, however,
are, after all, only a part of the general administration of
charity, though as they are now managed they have seldom any
systematic connexion with that administration. Nor is there
any co-ordination between the several hospitals and dispensaries.
If one rightly refuses further treatment to certain applicants,
they have only to wander to some other hospital, there to be
admitted with little or no scrutiny. For usually out-patients
and casualty patients are not even registered, nor can they be
identified if they apply again. Practically they come and go at
will. The definite limitation of cases, according to some standard
of effectual work, association with general charity, trained
almonership and inquiry, and a just regard for the interests of
general practitioners, are stepping-stones to reform. In towns
where medical charities are numerous a representative board
would promote mutual help and organization.</p>

<p>Like the poor-law, endowed charities may be permanent
institutions established to meet what should be passing and
decreasing needs (cf. the arguments in <i>The State and
Charity</i>, by T. Mackay). Administered as they usually
<span class="sidenote">Endowed charities.</span>
are in isolation&mdash;apart from the living voluntary
charities of the generation, and consisting often of small trusts
difficult to utilize satisfactorily, they tend to create a permanent
demand which they meet by fixed quantities of relief. Also, as
a rule, they make no systematic inquiries with a view to the
verification of the statements of the applicants, for they have no
staff for these purposes; nor have they the assistance of almoners
or friendly visitors. Nor does the relief which they give form
part of any plan of help in conjunction with other aid from
without; nor is the administration subject to frequent inspection,
as in the case of the poor-law. All these conditions have led to
a want of progress in the actual administration of endowed
charities, in regard to which it is often very difficult to prevent
the exercise of an undue patronage. But there is no reason why
these charities should not become a responsible part of the
country&rsquo;s administration, aiding it to reduce outdoor pauperism.
It was never intended that the poor-law should extinguish the
endowed charities, still less, as statistics now prove, that where
endowments abound the rate of pauperism should be considerably
above the average of the rest of the country. This shows that
these charities often foster pauperism instead of preventing it.
As a step to reform, the publication of an annual register of
endowed charities in England and Wales is greatly needed. The
consolidating schemes of the charity commissioners have done
much good; still more may be done in some counties by extending
to the county the benefits of the charities of well-endowed towns,
as has been accomplished by the extension of the eleemosynary
endowments of the city of London to the metropolitan police
area. Nor, again, until quite lately, and that as yet only in a few
schemes, has the principle been adopted that pensions or other
relief should be given only in supplementation of the relief of
relations, former employers and friends, and not in substitution
of it. This, coupled with good methods of inquiry and supervision,
has proved very beneficial. Hitherto, however, to a large
extent, endowed charities, it must be admitted, have tended to
weaken the family and to pauperize.</p>

<p>In many places funds are raised for the relief of school children
by the supply of meals during the winter and spring; and an act
has now been passed in England (1906) enabling the cost to be
put upon the rates. Usually a very large number of children
<span class="sidenote">Relief to children at school.</span>
are said to be underfed, but inquiry shows that such statements
may be taken as altogether excessive. They
are sometimes based on information drawn from the
children at school; or sometimes on general deductions;
they are seldom founded on any systematic and
competent inquiry at the homes. When this has been made,
the numbers dwindle to very small proportions. Teachers of
experience have noted the effect of the meals in weakening
the independence of the family. While they are forthcoming
women sometimes give up cooking meals at home, use their money
for other things, and tell the child he can get his meal at school.
Great temptations are put before a parent to neglect her family,
and very much distress is due to this. The meals&mdash;just at a
time when, owing to the age of her children, the mother&rsquo;s care
is most needed, and just in those families where the temptation
is greatest, and where the family instinct should be strengthened&mdash;stimulate
this neglect. Considered from the point of view
of meeting by eleemosynary provision a normal economic
demand for food, intervention can only have one result. The
demand must continue to outstrip the supply, so long as there are
resources available on the one side, and until on the other side
the desire of the social class that is chiefly exposed to the temptations
of dependence in relation to such relief has been satisfied.
If the provision be made from the resources of local or general
taxation the largeness of the fund available will allow practically
of an unlimited expansion of the supply of food. If the provision
be made from voluntary sources, in some measure limited therefore
and less certain, this very fact will tend to circumscribe
demand and limit the offer of relief. It is indeed the problem
of poor-law relief in 1832 over again. The relief provided by
local taxation practically unlimited will create a mass of constant
claimants, with a kind of assumed right to aid based on the
payment of rates; while voluntary relief, whatever its short-comings,
will be less injurious because it is less amply endowed.
In Paris the municipal subvention for meals rose from 545,900
francs in 1892 to 1,000,000 in 1904. Between 1894 and 1904 there
was an increase of 9% in the school population; and an increase
of 28% in the municipal grant. In that period the contributions
from the local school funds (<i>caisses des écoles</i>) decreased
36%; while the voluntary contributions otherwise received
were insignificant; and the payments for meals increased 2%.</p>

<p>The subject has been lately considered from a somewhat
different standpoint (cf. the reports of the Scottish Royal Commission
on Physical Education, 1903; of the Inter-departmental
committees on Physical Deterioration, 1905, and on Medical
Inspection and the Feeding of School Children, 1905; also the
report of the special committee of the Charity Organization
Society on &ldquo;the assistance of school children,&rdquo; 1893). After
careful investigations medical officers especially have drawn
attention to the low physical condition of children in schools
in the poorer parts of large English towns, their low stature,
their physical defects, the improper food supplied to them at
home, their uncleanliness, and their want of decent bringing-up,
and sometimes their want of food. Other inquiries have shown
that, as women more usually become breadwinners their children
receive less attention, and the home and its duties are neglected,
while in the lowest sections of the poorer classes social irresponsibility
reaches its maximum. Cheap but often quite improper
food is provided, and infant mortality, which is largely preventable,
remains as high as ever, though adult life is longer. This
with a marked decrease in the birth-rate in recent years, has,
it may be said, opened out a new field for charitable effort and
social work. Science is at each revision of the problem making
its task more definite. Actually the mere demand for meals
stands for less; the reform of home conditions for more. So it
was hoped that instead of making school meals a charge on
taxation, as parliament has done, it would be content to leave
it a voluntary charge, while the medical inspection of elementary
Schools will be made universal; representative relief committees
formed for schools or groups of schools; the cases of want or
distress among the school children dealt with individually in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page889" id="page889"></a>889</span>
connexion with their families, and, where necessary, day schools
established on the lines of day industrial schools.</p>

<p>At a time of exceptional distress the following suggestions
founded on much English experience may be of service (cf.
Report of special committee of the Charity Organization
Society on the best means of dealing with exceptional
<span class="sidenote">Exceptional distress.</span>
distress, 1886).    Usually at such a time proposals are
made to establish special funds, and to provide employment
to men and women out of work.    But it is best, if possible
and as long as possible, to rely on existing agencies, and to
strengthen them.    Round them there are usually workers more
or less trained.    A new fund usually draws to it new people, many
of whom may not have had any special experience at all.    If a
new fund is inevitable, it is best that it should make its grants
to existing agencies after consultation with them.    In any case,
a clear policy should be adopted, and people should keep their
heads.    The exaggeration of feeling at a time of apprehended or
actual distress is sometimes extraordinary, and the unwise action
which it prompts is often a cause of continuing pauperism afterwards.
Where there is public or poor-law relief the following
plan may be adopted:&mdash;In any large town there are usually
different recognized poor-law, charitable or other areas.    The
local people already at work in these areas should be formed
into local committees.    In each case a quick inquiry should be
made, and the relieving officer communicated with, some central
facts verified, and the home visited.    Roughly, cases may be
divided into three classes: the irresponsible casual labouring
class, a middle class of men with decent homes, who have made
no provision for the future, and are not members of either friendly
society or trades union; and a third class, who have made some
provision.    These usually are affected last of all; at all hazards
they should be kept from receiving public relief, and should be
helped, as far as possible, privately and personally.    If there
are public works, the second class might be referred to them; if
there are not, probably some should be left to the poor-law, some
assisted in the same way as members of class three.    Much would
turn upon the family and the home.    The first class should be
left to the poor-law.    If there is no poor-law system at work they
should be put on public works.    Working men of independent
position, not the creatures of any political club, but such as are
respected members of a friendly society, or are otherwise well
qualified for the task, should be called into consultation.    The
relief should be settled according to the requirements of each case,
but if the pressure is great, at first at least it may be necessary
to make grants according to some generally sufficient scale.  There
should be as constant a revision of cases as time permits.    Great
care should be taken to stop the relief as soon as possible, and to do
nothing to make it the stepping-stone to permanent dependence.</p>

<p>If employment be provided it should be work within the skill
of all; it should be fairly remunerated, so that at least the
scantiness of the pay may not be an excuse for neglect; and it
should be paid for according to measured or piece work.    The
discipline should be strict, though due regard should be paid
at first to those unaccustomed to digging or earthwork.    In
England and Wales the guardians have power to open labour
yards.    These, like charities which provide work, tend to attract
and keep in employment a low class of labourer or workman,
who finds it pays him to use the institution as a convenience.
It is best, therefore, to avoid the opening of a labour yard
if possible.    If it is opened, the discipline should be very strict,
and when there is laziness or insubordination, relief in the workhouse
should at once be offered.    The relief furnished to men
employed in a labour yard, of which in England at least half has
to be given ih kind, should, it has been said, be dealt out from
day to day.    This leads to the men giving up the work sooner
than they otherwise would.    They have less to spend.</p>

<p>In Great Britain a great change has taken place in regard
to the provision of employment in connexion with the state.
Since about 1890 there has been a feeling that men in
distress from want of employment should not be dealt
<span class="sidenote">Unemployment.</span>
with by the poor-law. A circular letter issued by the
Local Government Board in 1886, and subsequently in 1895,
coincided with this feeling. It was addressed to town councils
and other local authorities, asking them to provide work (1)
which will not involve the stigma of pauperism, (2) which all
can perform whatever may have been their previous avocations,
and (3) which does not compete with that of other labourers
at present in employment. This circular led to the vestries and
subsequently the borough councils in many districts becoming
partially recognized relief authorities for the unemployed,
concurrently with the poor-law. Much confusion resulted.
The local authorities had seldom any suitable organization for
the investigation of applications. It was difficult to supply
work on the terms required; and the work was often ill-done
and costly. Also it was found that the same set of people would
apply year after year, unskilled labourers usually out of work
part of the winter, or men habitually &ldquo;unemployed.&rdquo; As on
other occasions when public work was provided, very few of the
applicants were found to be artisans, or members of trades
unions or of friendly societies. In 1904 Mr Long, then president
of the Local Government Board, proposed that local voluntary
distress committees should be established in London consisting
of poor-law guardians and town councillors and others, more or
less supervised by a central committee and ultimately by the
Local Government Board. This organization was set on foot
and large sums were subscribed for its work. The report on
the results of the movement was somewhat doubtful (Report,
London Unemployed Fund, 1904-1905, p. 101, &amp;c.), but in 1905
the Unemployed Workmen&rsquo;s Act was passed, and in London
and elsewhere distress committees like the voluntary committees
of the previous year were established by statute. It was enacted
that for establishment expenses, emigration and removal, labour
exchanges, and the acquisition of land a halfpenny rate might
be levied, but that the rate would not be available for the remuneration
of men employed. For this purpose (1905-1906)
a large charitable fund was raised. A training farm at Hollesley
Bay was acquired, and it was hoped to train Londoners there
to become fit for agricultural work. It is impossible to judge this
experiment properly, on the evidence available up to 1908.
But one or two points are important: (1) something very like
the &ldquo;right to labour&rdquo; has been granted by the legislature;
(2) this has been done apart from the conditions required by the
poor-laws and orders of the Local Government Board on poor
relief and without imposing disfranchisement on the men
employed; (3) a labour rate has not been levied, but a rate has
been levied in aid of the provision of employment; (4) if the line
of development that the act suggests were to be followed (as the
renewed Labour agitation in 1908-1909 made probable) it must
tend to create a class of &ldquo;unemployed,&rdquo; unskilled labourers
of varying grades of industry who may become the dependent
and state-supported proletariat of modern urban life. Thus,
unless the administration be extremely rigorous, once more
will a kind of serfdom be established, to be, as some would say,
taken over hereafter by the socialist state.</p>

<p>In some of the English colonies Homeric hospitality still
prevails, but by degrees the station-house or some refuge is
established in the towns as they grow more populous.
Finally, some system of labour in exchange for relief
<span class="sidenote">Vagrancy.</span>
is evolved. At first this is voluntary, afterwards it is officially
recognized, and finally it may become part of the system of
public relief. As bad years come, these changes are made step
by step. In England the vagrant or wayfarer is tolerated and
discouraged, but not kept employed. He should be under greater
pressure to maintain himself, it is thought. The provision made
for him in different parts of the country is far from uniform, and
now, usually, at least in the larger towns, after he has had a bath
and food, he is admitted to a separate room or cell in a casual
ward. Before he leaves he has to do a task of work, and, subject
to the discretion of the master, he is detained two nights. This
plan has reduced vagrancy, and if it were universally adopted
clean accommodation would everywhere be provided for the
vagrant without the attractions of a common or &ldquo;associated&rdquo;
ward; and probably vagrancy would diminish still further. It
seems almost needless to say that, in these circumstances at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page890" id="page890"></a>890</span>
rate, casual alms should not be given to vagrants. They know
much better how to provide for themselves than the almsgiver
imagines, for vagrancy is in the main a mode of life not the result
of any casual difficulty. Vagrancy and criminality are also nearly
allied. The magistrate, therefore, rather than the almsgiver,
should usually interfere; and, as a rule, where the magistrates
are strict, vagrancy in a county diminishes. An inter-departmental
committee (1906) taking generally this line, reported
in favour of vagrants being placed entirely under police control,
and it recommended a system of wayfarers&rsquo; tickets for men on
the roads who are not habitual vagrants, and the committal
of men likely to become habitual vagrants to certified labour
colonies for not less than six months. Still undoubtedly vagrancy
has its economic side. In a bad year the number of tramps is
increased by the addition of unskilled and irresponsible labourers,
who are soonest discharged when work is slack. As a part-voluntary
system under official recognition the German <i>Arbeiter-colonien</i>
are of interest. This in a measure has led to the introduction
of labour homes in England, the justification of which should
be that they recruit the energy of the men who find their way to
them, and enable them to earn a living which they could not do
otherwise. In a small percentage of cases their result may be
achieved. Charitable refuges or philanthropic common lodging-houses,
usually established in districts where this class already
congregate, only aggravate the difficulty. They give additional
attractions to a vagrant and casual life, and make it more
endurable. They also make a comfortable avoidance of the
responsibilities of family life comparatively easy, and in so far
as they do this they are clearly injurious to the community.</p>

<p>The English colonists of the New England states and Pennsylvania
introduced the disciplinary religious and relief system of
Protestantism and the Elizabethan poor-law. To
the former reference has already been made. With an
<span class="sidenote">American conditions and methods.</span>
appreciation of the fact that the cause of distress is
not usually poverty, but weakness of character and
want of judgment, and that relief is in itself no remedy, those
who have inherited the old Puritan traditions have, in the light
of toleration and a larger social experience, organized the
method of friendly visiting, the object of which is illustrated by
the motto, &ldquo;Not alms, but a friend.&rdquo; To the friendship of
charity is thus given a disciplinary force, capable of immense
expansion and usefulness, if the friendship on the side of those
who would help is sincere and guided by practical knowledge
and sagacity, and if on the side of those in distress there is
awakened a reciprocal regard and a willingness to change their
way of life by degrees. Visiting by &ldquo;districts&rdquo; is set aside, for
&ldquo;friendliness&rdquo; is not a quality easily diffused over a wide area.
To be real it must be limited as time and ability allow. Consequently,
a friendly visitor usually befriends but one or two,
or in any case only a few, families. The friendly visitor is the
outcome of the movement for &ldquo;associated charities,&rdquo; but in
America charity organization societies have also adopted the
term, and to a certain extent the method. Between the two
movements there is the closest affinity. The registration of
applicants for relief is much more complete in American cities
than in England, where the plan meets with comparatively little
support. At the office of the associated charities in Boston there
is a central and practically a complete register of all the applications
made to the public authority for poor relief, to the associated
charities, and to many other voluntary bodies.</p>

<p>The Elizabethan poor-law system, with the machinery of
overseers, poor-houses and out-door relief, is still maintained
in New England, New York state and Pennsylvania, but with
many modifications, especially in New York. A chief factor in
these changes has been immigration. While the County or town
remained the administrative area for local poor relief, the large
number of immigrant and &ldquo;unsettled&rdquo; poor, and the business
connected with their removal from the state, entailed the establishment
of a secondary or state system of administration and
aid, with special classes of institutions to which the counties
or towns could send their poor, as, for instance, state reform
schools, farms, almshouses, &amp;c. For the oversight of these
institutions, and often of prisons also and lunatic asylums, in
many states there have been established state boards of &ldquo;charity
or corrections and charity.&rdquo; The members of these boards are
selected by the state for a term of years, and give their services
honorarily. There are state boards in Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Colorado, North Carolina and elsewhere. There is also a
district board of charities in the district of Columbia. These
boards publish most useful and detailed reports. Besides the state
board there is sometimes also, as in New York, a State Charities
Aid Association, whose members, in the counties in which they
reside, have a legal right of entry to visit and inspect any public
or charitable institution owned by the state, and any county and
other poor-house. A large association of visitors accustomed
to inspect and report on institutions has thus been created.
Further, the counties and towns in New York state, for instance,
and Massachusetts, and the almshouse districts in Pennsylvania,
are under boards of supervision. Usually the overseers give out-door
relief, and the pauperism of some areas is as high as that
in some English unions, 3, 4 and 5%. On the whole population
of the United States, however, and of individual states, consisting
to a great extent of comparatively young and energetic immigrants,
the pauperism is insignificant. In Massachusetts &ldquo;it
has been the general policy of the state to order the removal
to the state almshouse of unsettled residents of the several cities
and towns in need of temporary aid, thus avoiding some of the
abuses incident to out-door relief.&rdquo; In New York state, in the
city of New York, including Brooklyn, the distribution of out-door
relief by the department of charities is forbidden, except
for purposes of transportation and for the adult blind. Most
counties in the state have an almshouse, and the county superintendents
and overseers of the poor &ldquo;furnish necessary relief to
such of the county poor as may require only temporary assistance,
or are so disabled that they cannot be safely removed to the
almshouse.&rdquo; Public attention is in many cases being drawn
to the inutility and injury of out-door relief.</p>

<p>In some states and cities the system of subsidizing voluntary
institutions is in full force, and it is in force also in many English
colonies. At first sight it has the advantage of providing relief
for public purposes without the creation of a new staff or establishment.
There is thus an apparent economy. But the evils
are many. Political partisanship and favour may influence the
amount and disposition of the grants. The grants act as a
bounty on the establishment and continuance of charitable
institutions, homes for children, hospitals, &amp;c., but not on the
expansion of the voluntary charitable funds and efforts that
should maintain them; and thus charitable homes exist in which
charity in its truer sense may have little part, but in which the
chief motive of the administration may be to support sectarian
interests by public subsidies. Claimants for relief have little
scruple in turning such institutions to their own account; and
the institutions, being financially irresponsible, are not in these
circumstances scrupulous on their side to prevent a misdirection
of their bounties. &ldquo;Parents unload their children upon the
community more recklessly when they know that such children
will be provided for in private orphan asylums and protectories,
where the religious training that the parents prefer will be given
them&rdquo; (Amos G. Warner, in <i>International Congress: Charities
and Correction</i>, 1893). Past history in New York city illustrates
the same evil. The admission was entirely in the hands of the
managers. They admitted; the city paid. In New York city
the population between 1870 and 1890 increased about 80%;
the subsidies for prisoners and public paupers increased by 43%,
but those for paupers in private institutions increased from
$334,828 to $1,845,872, or about 461%. The total was at that
time $3,794,972; in 1898 it was rather less, $3,132,786. The
alternative to this system is either the establishment of state or
municipal institutions, and possibly in special cases payments
to voluntary homes for the maintenance of inmates admitted at
the request of a state authority, as at certified and other homes in
England, with grants made conditional on the work being conducted
on specified lines, and subject to a certain increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page891" id="page891"></a>891</span>
amount of voluntary financial support; or a close general and
financial inspection of charitable institutions&mdash;the method of
reform adopted in New York; or payment for only those inmates
who are sent by public authorities and admitted on their request.</p>

<p>The enormous extent to which children&rsquo;s aid societies have
been increased in the United States, sometimes with the help of
considerable public grants, suggests the greatest need for caution
from the point of the preservation of the family as the central
element of social strength in the community. The problem of
charity in relation to medical relief in the large towns of the
United States is similar to that of England; its difficulties are
alike.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;As good translations of the classics become accessible
it is easy for the general reader or student to combine a
study of the principles of charity in relation to the community with
a study of history. Thus, and in connexion with special investigations
and the conditions of practical charity, social economics
may best be studied. In N. Masterman, <i>Chalmers on Charity</i> (1900);
T. Mackay, <i>Methods of Social Reform</i> (1896); B. Bosanquet and
others, <i>Some Aspects of the Social Problem</i> (1894); and C.S. Loch,
<i>Methods of Social Advance</i> (1904), this point of view is generally
assumed. Special investigations of importance may be found in the
reports of medical officers of health. See Report of Committee on
Physical Deterioration referred to above, and, for instance, Dr Newsholme&rsquo;s
<i>Vital Statistics</i> and Charles Booth&rsquo;s <i>Labour and Life in
London</i>. For the history of charity there is no good single work.
On details there are many good articles in Daremberg&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary
of Classical Antiquities</i>, and similar works. <i>Modern Methods of
Charity</i>, by C.H. Henderson and others (1904), supplies much
general information in regard to poor relief and charity in different
countries. Apart from books and official documents mentioned
in the text as indicating the present state of charitable and public
relief, or as aids to practical work, the following may be of service.

<p><span class="bold">CHARIVARI,<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> a French term of uncertain origin, but probably
onomatopoeic, for a mock serenade &ldquo;rough music,&rdquo; made by
beating on kettles, fire-irons, tea-trays or what not. The
charivari was anciently in France a regular wedding custom, all
bridal couples being thus serenaded. Later it was reserved for
ill-assorted and unpopular marriages, for widows or widowers
who remarried too soon, and generally as a mockery for all who
were unpopular. At the beginning of the 17th century, wedding
charivaris were forbidden by the Council of Tours under pain of
excommunication, but the custom still lingers in rural districts.
The French of Louisiana and Canada introduced the charivari
into America, where it became known under the corrupted name
of &ldquo;shivaree.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLEMAGNE<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Charles the Great</span>] (c. 742-814), Roman
emperor, and king of the Franks, was the elder son of Pippin the
Short, king of the Franks, and Bertha, or Bertrada, daughter of
Charibert, count of Laon. The place of his birth is unknown and
its date uncertain, although some authorities give it as the 2nd of
April 742; doubts have been cast upon his legitimacy, and it is
just possible that the marriage of Pippin and Bertha took place
subsequent to the birth of their elder son. When Pippin was
crowned king of the Franks at St Denis on the 28th of July 754
by Pope Stephen II., Charles, and his brother Carloman were
anointed by the pope as a sign of their kingly rank. The rough
surroundings of the Frankish court were unfavourable to the
acquisition of learning, and Charles grew up almost ignorant of
letters, but hardy in body and skilled in the use of weapons.</p>

<p>In 761 he accompanied his father on a campaign in Aquitaine,
and in 763 undertook the government of several counties. In
768 Pippin divided his dominions between his two sons, and on his
death soon afterwards Charles became the ruler of the northern
portion of the Frankish kingdom, and was crowned at Noyon on
the 9th of October 768. Bad feeling had existed for some time
between Charles and Carloman, and when Charles early in 769
was called upon to suppress a rising in Aquitaine, his brother
refused to afford him any assistance. This rebellion, however,
was easily crushed, its leader, the Aquitainian duke Hunold, was
made prisoner, and his territory more closely attached to the
Frankish kingdom. About this time Bertha, having effected a
temporary reconciliation between her sons, overcame the repugnance
with which Pope Stephen III. regarded an alliance
between Frank and Lombard, and brought about a marriage
between Charles and a daughter of Desiderius, king of the
Lombards. Charles had previously contracted a union, probably
of an irregular nature, with a Frankish lady named Himiltrude,
who had borne him a son Pippin, the &ldquo;Hunchback.&rdquo; The peace
with the Lombards, in which the Bavarians as allies of Desiderius
joined, was, however, soon broken. Charles thereupon repudiated
his Lombard wife (Bertha or Desiderata) and married in
771 a princess of the Alamanni named Hildegarde. Carloman
died in December 771, and Charles was at once recognized at
Corbeny as sole king of the Franks. Carloman&rsquo;s widow Gerberga
had fled to the protection of the Lombard king, who espoused her
cause and requested the new pope, Adrian I., to recognize her two
sons as the lawful Frankish kings. Adrian, between whom and
the Lombards other causes of quarrel existed, refused to assent
to this demand, and when Desiderius invaded the papal territories
he appealed to the Frankish king for help. Charles, who
was at the moment engaged in his first Saxon campaign, expostulated
with Desiderius; but when such mild measures
proved useless he led his forces across the Alps in 773. Gerberga
and her children were delivered up and disappear from history;
the siege of Pavia was undertaken; and at Easter 774 the king
left the seat of war and visited Rome, where he was received with
great respect.</p>

<p>During his stay in the city Charles renewed the donation which
his father Pippin had made to the papacy in 754 or 756. This
transaction has given rise to much discussion as to its trustworthiness
and the extent of its operation. Our only authority,
a passage in the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i>, describes the gift as including
the whole of Italy and Corsica, except the lands north of the Po,
Calabria and the city of Naples. The vast extent of this donation,
which, moreover, included territories not owning Charles&rsquo;s
authority, and the fact that the king did not execute, or
apparently attempt to execute, its provisions, has caused many
scholars to look upon the passage as a forgery; but the better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page892" id="page892"></a>892</span>
opinion would appear to be that it is genuine, or at least has a
genuine basis. Various explanations have been suggested. The
area of the grant may have been enlarged by later interpolations;
or it may have dealt with property rather than with
sovereignty, and have only referred to estates claimed by the
pope in the territories named; or it is possible that Charles may
have actually intended to establish an extensive papal kingdom
in Italy, but was released from his promise by Adrian when the
pope saw no chance of its fulfilment. Another supposition is that the
author of the <i>Liber Pontificalis</i> gives the papal interpretation
of a grant that had been expressed by Pippin in ambiguous
terms; and this view is supported by the history of the
subsequent controversy between king and pope.</p>

<p>Returning to the scene of hostilities, Charles witnessed the
capitulation of Pavia in June 774, and the capture of Desiderius,
who was sent into a monastery. He now took the title &ldquo;king of
the Lombards,&rdquo; to which he added the dignity of &ldquo;Patrician of
the Romans,&rdquo; which had been granted to his father. Adalgis,
the son of Desiderius, who was residing at Constantinople, hoped
the emperor Leo IV. would assist him in recovering his father&rsquo;s
kingdom; but a coalition formed for this purpose was ineffectual,
and a rising led by his ally Rothgaud, duke of Friuli, was easily
crushed by Charles in 776. In 777 the king was visited at Paderborn
by three Saracen chiefs who implored his aid against
Abd-ar-Rahman, the caliph of Cordova, and promised some Spanish
cities in return for help. Seizing this opportunity to extend his
influence Charles marched into Spain in 778 and took Pampeluna,
but meeting with some checks decided to return. As the Frankish
forces were defiling through the passes of the Pyrenees they were
attacked by the Wascones (probably Basques), and the rear-guard
of the army was almost annihilated. It was useless to
attempt to avenge this disaster, which occurred on the 15th of
August 778, for the enemy disappeared as quickly as he came;
the incident has passed from the domain of history into that of
legend and romance, being associated by tradition with the pass
of Roncesvalles. Among the slain was one Hruodland, or Roland,
margrave of the Breton march, whose death gave rise to the
<i>Chanson de Roland</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roland, Legend of</a></span>).</p>

<p>Charles now sought to increase his authority in Italy, where
Frankish counts were set over various districts, and where
Hildebrand, duke of Spoleto, appears to have recognized his
overlordship. In 780 he was again in the peninsula, and at
Mantua issued an important <i>capitulary</i> which increased the
authority of the Lombard bishops, relieved freemen who under
stress of famine had sold themselves into servitude, and
condemned abuses of the system of vassalage. At the same time
commerce was encouraged by the abolition of unauthorized
tolls and by an improvement of the coinage; while the sale of
arms to hostile peoples, and the trade in Christian slaves were
forbidden. Proceeding to Rome, the king appears to have
come to some arrangement with Adrian about the donation of
774. At Easter 781, Carloman, his second son by Hildegarde,
was renamed Pippin and crowned king of Italy by Pope Adrian,
and his youngest son Louis was crowned king of Aquitaine;
but no mention was made at the time of his eldest son Charles,
who was doubtless intended to be king of the Franks. In 783
the king, having lost his wife Hildegarde, married Fastrada,
the daughter of a Frankish count named Radolf; and in the
same year his mother Bertha died. The emperor Constantine VI.
was at this time exhibiting some interest in Italian affairs, and
Adalgis the Lombard was still residing at his court; so Charles
sought to avert danger from this quarter by consenting in 781 to
a marriage between Constantine and his own daughter Rothrude.
In 786 the entreaties of the pope and the hostile attitude of
Arichis II., duke of Benevento, a son-in-law of Desiderius, called
the king again into Italy. Arichis submitted without a struggle,
though the basis of Frankish authority in his duchy was far from
secure; but in conjunction with Adalgis he sought aid from
Constantinople. His plans were ended by his death in 787, and
although the empress Irene, the real ruler of the eastern empire,
broke off the projected marriage between her son and Rothrude,
she appears to have given very little assistance to Adalgis,
whose attack on Italy was easily repulsed. During this visit
Charles had presented certain towns to Adrian, but an estrangement
soon arose between king and pope over the claim of Charles
to confirm the election to the archbishopric of Ravenna, and it
was accentuated by Adrian&rsquo;s objection to the establishment by
Charles of Grimoald III. as duke of Benevento, in succession to
his father Arichis.</p>

<p>These journeys and campaigns, however, were but interludes
in the long and stubborn struggle between Charles and the Saxons,
which began in 772 and ended in 804 with the incorporation of
Saxony in the Carolingian empire (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saxony</a></span>). This contest,
in which the king himself took a very active part, brought the
Franks into collision with the Wiltzi, a tribe dwelling east of the
Elbe, who in 789 was reduced to dependence. A similar sequence
of events took place in southern Germany. Tassilo III., duke of
the Bavarians, who had on several occasions adopted a line of
conduct inconsistent with his allegiance to Charles, was deposed
in 788 and his duchy placed under the rule of Gerold, a
brother-in-law of Charles, to be governed on the Frankish system
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bavaria</a></span>). Having thus taken upon himself the control of
Bavaria, Charles felt himself responsible for protecting its
eastern frontier, which had long been menaced by the Avars,
a people inhabiting the region now known as Hungary. He
accordingly ravaged their country in 791 at the head of an army
containing Saxon, Frisian, Bavarian and Alamannian warriors,
which penetrated as far as the Raab; and he spent the following
year in Bavaria preparing for a second campaign against them,
the conduct of which, however, he was compelled by further
trouble in Saxony to entrust to his son king Pippin, and to Eric,
margrave of Friuli. These deputies succeeded in 795 and 796
in taking possession of the vast treasures of the Avars, which
were distributed by the king with lavish generosity to churches,
courtiers and friends. A conspiracy against Charles, which his
friend and biographer Einhard alleges was provoked by the
cruelties of Queen Fastrada, was suppressed without difficulty
in 792, and its leader, the king&rsquo;s illegitimate son Pippin, was
confined in a monastery till his death in 811. Fastrada died in
August 794, when Charles took for his fourth wife an Alamannian
lady named Liutgarde.</p>

<p>The continuous interest taken by the king in ecclesiastical
affairs was shown at the synod of Frankfort, over which he
presided in 794. It was on his initiative that this synod
condemned the heresy of <i>adoptianism</i> and the worship of images,
which had been restored in 787 by the second council of Nicaea;
and at the same time that council was declared to have been
superfluous. This policy caused a further breach with Pope
Adrian; but when Adrian died in December 795, his successor,
Leo III., in notifying his elevation to the king, sent him the keys
of St Peter&rsquo;s grave and the banner of the city, and asked Charles
to send an envoy to receive his oath of fidelity. There is no
doubt that Leo recognized Charles as sovereign of Rome. He
was the first pope to date his acts according to the years of the
Frankish monarchy, and a mosaic of the time in the Lateran
palace represents St Peter bestowing the banners upon Charles
as a token of temporal supremacy, while the coinage issued by
the pope bears witness to the same idea. Leo soon had occasion
to invoke the aid of his protector. In 799, after he had been
attacked and maltreated in the streets of Rome during a procession,
he escaped to the king at Paderborn, and Charles sent him
back to Italy escorted by some of his most trusted servants.
Taking the same journey himself shortly afterwards, the king
reached Rome in 800 for the purpose (as he declared) of restoring
discipline in the church. His authority was undisputed; and
after Leo had cleared himself by an oath of certain charges made
against him, Charles restored the pope and banished his leading
opponents.</p>

<p>The great event of this visit took place on the succeeding
Christmas Day, when Charles on rising from prayer in St Peter&rsquo;s
was crowned by Leo and proclaimed emperor and <i>augustus</i>
amid the acclamations of the crowd. This act can hardly have
been unpremeditated, and some doubt has been cast upon the
statement which Einhard attributes to Charles, that he would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page893" id="page893"></a>893</span>
have entered the building had he known of the intention of Leo.
He accepted the dignity at any rate without demur, and there
seems little doubt that the question of assuming, or obtaining,
this title had previously been discussed. His policy had been
steadily leading up to this position, which was rather the
emblem of the power he already held than an extension of the
area of his authority. It is probable therefore that Charles
either considered the coronation premature, as he was hoping
to obtain the assent of the eastern empire to this step, or that,
from fear of evils which he foresaw from the claim of the pope
to crown the emperor, he wished to crown himself. All the
evidence tends to show that it was the time or manner of the
act rather than the act itself which aroused his temporary
displeasure. Contemporary accounts lay stress upon the fact
that as there was then no emperor, Constantinople being under
the rule of Irene, it seemed good to Leo and his counsellors and
the &ldquo;rest of the Christian people&rdquo; to choose Charles, already
ruler of Rome, to fill the vacant office. However doubtful such
conjectures concerning his intentions may be, it is certain that
immediately after his coronation Charles sought to establish
friendly relations with Constantinople, and even suggested a
marriage between himself and Irene, as he had again become a
widower in 800. The deposition and death of the empress foiled
this plan; and after a desultory warfare in Italy between the
two empires, negotiations were recommenced which in 810 led
to an arrangement between Charles and the eastern emperor,
Nicephorus I. The death of Nicephorus and the accession of
Michael I. did not interfere with the relations, and in 812 an
embassy from Constantinople arrived at Aix-la-Chapelle, when
Charles was acknowledged as emperor, and in return agreed to
cede Venice and Dalmatia to Michael.</p>

<p>Increasing years and accumulating responsibilities now caused
the emperor to alter somewhat his manner of life. No longer
leading his armies in person he entrusted the direction of
campaigns in various parts of his empire to his sons and other
lieutenants, and from his favourite residence at Aix watched their
progress with a keen and sustained interest. In 802 he ordered
that a new oath of fidelity to him as emperor should be taken by
all his subjects over twelve years of age. In 804 he was visited
by Pope Leo, who returned to Rome laden with gifts. Before
his coronation as emperor, Charles had entered into communications
with the caliph of Bagdad, Harun-al-Rashid, probably in
order to protect the eastern Christians, and in 801 he had received
an embassy and presents from Harun. In the same year the
patriarch of Jerusalem sent him the keys of the Holy Sepulchre;
and in 807 Harun not only sent further gifts, but appears to
have confirmed the emperor&rsquo;s rights in Jerusalem, which, however,
probably amounted to no more than an undefined protectorate
over the Christians in that part of the world. While thus
extending his influence even into Asia, there was scarcely any
part of Europe where the power of Charles did not make itself
felt. He had not visited Spain since the disaster of Roncesvalles,
but he continued to take a lively interest in the affairs of that
country. In 798 he had concluded an alliance with Alphonso II.,
king of the Asturias, and a series of campaigns mainly under the
leadership of King Louis resulted in the establishment of the
&ldquo;Spanish march,&rdquo; a district between the Pyrenees and the Ebro
stretching from Pampeluna to Barcelona, as a defence against
the Saracens. In 799 the Balearic Islands had been handed over
to Charles, and a long warfare was carried on both by sea and
land between Frank and Saracen until 810, when peace was made
between the emperor and El-Hakem, the emir of Cordova. Italy
was equally the scene of continuous fighting. Grimoald of Benevento
rebelled against his overlord; the possession of Venice
and Dalmatia was disputed by the two empires; and Istria
was brought into subjection.</p>

<p>With England the emperor had already entered into relations,
and at one time a marriage was proposed between his son Charles
and a daughter of Offa, king of the Mercians. English exiles
were welcomed at his court; he was mainly instrumental in
restoring Eardwulf to the throne of Northumbria in 809; and
Einhard includes the Scots within the sphere of his influence.
In eastern Europe the Avars had owned themselves completely
under his power in 805; campaigns against the Czechs in 805
and 806 had met with some success, and about the same time
the land of the Sorbs was ravaged; while at the western extremity
of the continent the Breton nobles had done homage
to Charles at Tours in 800. Thus the emperor&rsquo;s dominions now
stretched from the Eider to the Ebro, and from the Atlantic to
the Elbe, the Saale and the Raab, and they also included the
greater part of Italy; while even beyond these bounds he exercised
an acknowledged but shadowy authority. In 806 Charles
arranged a division of his territories among his three legitimate
sons, but this arrangement came to nothing owing to the death
of Pippin in 810, and of the younger Charles in the following
year. Charles then named his remaining son Louis as his successor;
and at his father&rsquo;s command Louis took the crown from
the altar and placed it upon his own head. This ceremony took
place at Aix on the 11th of September 813. In 808 the Frankish
authority over the Obotrites was interfered with by Gudrod
(Godfrey), king of the Danes, who ravaged the Frisian coasts
and spoke boastfully of leading his troops to Aix. To ward off
these attacks Charles took a warm interest in the building of a
fleet, which he reviewed in 811; but by this time Gudrod had
been killed, and his successor Hemming made peace with the
emperor.</p>

<p>In 811 Charles made his will, which shows that he contemplated
the possibility of abdication. The bulk of his possessions were
left to the twenty-one metropolitan churches of his dominions,
and the remainder to his children, his servants and the poor.
In his last years he passed most of his days at Aix, though
he had sufficient energy to take the field for a short time during
the Danish War. Early in 814 he was attacked by a fever which
he sought to subdue by fasting; but pleurisy supervened, and
after partaking of the communion, he died on the 28th of January
814, and on the same day his body was buried in the church of
St Mary at Aix. In the year 1000 his tomb was opened by the
emperor Otto III., but the account that Otto found the body
upright upon a throne with a golden crown on the head and holding
a golden sceptre in the hands, is generally regarded as legendary.
The tomb was again opened by the emperor Frederick I.
in 1165, when the remains were removed from a marble sarcophagus
and placed in a wooden coffin. Fifty years later they were
transferred by order of the emperor Frederick II. to a splendid
shrine, in which the relics are still exhibited once in every six
years. The sarcophagus in which the body originally lay may
still be seen at Aix, and other relics of the great emperor are in
the imperial treasury at Vienna. In 1165 Charles was canonized
by the antipope Paschal III. at the instance of the emperor
Frederick I., and Louis XI. of France gave strict orders that the
feast of the saint should be observed.</p>

<p>The personal appearance of Charles is thus described by
Einhard:&mdash;&ldquo;Big and robust in frame, he was tall, but not
excessively so, measuring about seven of his own feet in height.
His eyes were large and lustrous, his nose rather long and
his countenance bright and cheerful.&rdquo; He had a commanding
presence, a clear but somewhat feeble voice, and in later life
became rather corpulent. His health was uniformly good, owing
perhaps to his moderation in eating and drinking, and to
his love for hunting and swimming. He was an affectionate
father, and loved to pass his time in the company of his children,
to whose education he paid the closest attention. His sons were
trained for war and the chase, and his daughters instructed in the
spinning of wool and other feminine arts. His ideas of sexual
morality were primitive. Many concubines are spoken of, he
had several illegitimate children, and the morals of his daughters
were very loose. He was a regular observer of religious rites,
took great pains to secure decorum in the services of the church,
and was generous in almsgiving both within his empire and
without. He reformed the Frankish liturgy, and brought singers
from Rome to improve the services of the church. He had
considerable knowledge of theology, took a prominent part in the
theological controversies of the time, and was responsible for the
addition of the clause <i>filioque</i> to the Nicene Creed. The most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page894" id="page894"></a>894</span>
attractive feature of his character, however, was his love of
learning. In addition to his native tongue he could read Latin and
understood Greek, but he was unable to write, and Einhard
gives an account of his futile efforts to learn this art in later life.
He loved the reading of histories and astronomy, and by questioning
travellers gained some knowledge of distant parts of the
earth. He attended lectures on grammar, and his favourite
work was St Augustine&rsquo;s <i>De civitate Dei</i>. He caused Frankish
sagas to be collected, began a grammar of his native tongue, and
spent some of his last hours in correcting a text of the Vulgate.
He delighted in the society of scholars&mdash;Alcuin, Angilbert, Paul
the Lombard, Peter of Pisa and others, and in this company the
trappings of rank were laid aside and the emperor was known
simply as David. Under his patronage Alcuin organized the
school of the palace, where the royal children were taught in the
company of others, and founded a school at Tours which became
the model for many other establishments. Charles was unwearying
in his efforts to improve the education of clergy and
laity, and in 789 ordered that schools should be established in
every diocese. The atmosphere of these schools was strictly
ecclesiastical and the questions discussed by the scholars were
often puerile, but the greatness of the educational work of
Charles will not be doubted when one considers the rude condition
of Frankish society half a century before. The main work
of the Carolingian renaissance was to restore Latin to its
position as a literary language, and to reintroduce a correct
system of spelling and an improved handwriting. The
manuscripts of the time are accurate and artistic, copies of
valuable books were made and by careful collation the texts
were purified.</p>

<p>Charles was not a great warrior. His victories were won rather
by the power of organization, which he possessed in a marked
degree, and he was eager to seize ideas and prompt in their
execution. He erected a stone bridge with wooden piers across
the Rhine at Mainz, and began a canal between the Altmühl and
the Rednitz to connect the Rhine and the Danube, but this work
was not finished. He built palaces at Aix (his favourite residence),
Nijmwegen and Ingelheim, and erected the church of St Mary
at Aix, modelled on that of St Vitalis at Ravenna and adorned
with columns and mosaics brought from the same city. He
loved the simple dress and manners of the Franks, and on two
occasions only did he assume the more stately attire of a Roman
noble. The administrative system of Charles in church and
state was largely personal, and he brought to the work an untiring
industry, and a marvellous grasp of detail. He admonished
the pope, appointed the bishops, watched over the morals and
work of the clergy, and took an active part in the deliberations
of church synods; he founded bishoprics and monasteries,
was lavish in his gifts to ecclesiastical foundations, and chose
bishops and abbots for administrative work. As the real
founder of the ecclesiastical state, he must be held mainly
responsible for the evils which resulted from the policy of
the church in exalting the ecclesiastical over the secular
authority.</p>

<p>In secular affairs Charles abolished the office of duke, placed
counts over districts smaller than the former duchies, and
supervised their government by means of <i>missi dominici</i>,
officials responsible to himself alone. Marches were formed on all the
borders of the empire, and the exigencies of military service
led to the growth of a system of land-tenure which contained
the germ of feudalism. The assemblies of the people gradually
changed their character under his rule. No longer did the nation
come together to direct and govern, but the emperor summoned
his people to assent to his acts. Taking a lively interest in
commerce and agriculture, Charles issued various regulations
for the organization of the one and the improvement of the other.
He introduced a new system of weights and measures, which he
ordered should be used throughout his kingdom, and took steps
to reform the coinage. He was a voluminous lawgiver. Without
abolishing the customary law of the German tribes, which is
said to have been committed to writing by his orders, he
added to it by means of <i>capitularies</i>, and thus introduced
certain Christian principles and customs, and some degree of
uniformity.</p>

<p>The extent and glamour of his empire exercised a potent spell
on western Europe. The aim of the greatest of his successors
was to restore it to its pristine position and influence, while
many of the French rulers made its re-establishment the goal of
their policy. Otto the Great to a considerable extent succeeded;
Louis XIV. referred frequently to the empire of Charlemagne;
and Napoleon regarded him as his prototype and predecessor.
The empire of Charles, however, was not lasting. In spite of his
own wonderful genius the seeds of weakness were sown in his
lifetime. The church was too powerful, an incipient feudalism
was present, and there was no real bond of union between the
different races that acknowledged his authority. All the vigilance
of the emperor could not restrain the dishonesty and the
cupidity of his servants, and no sooner was the strong hand of
their ruler removed than they began to acquire territorial power
for themselves.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">The Charlemagne Legends</p>

<p>Innumerable legends soon gathered round the memory of the
great emperor. He was represented as a warrior performing
superhuman feats, as a ruler dispensing perfect justice, and even
as a martyr suffering for the faith. It was confidently believed
towards the close of the 10th century that he had made a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem; and, like many other great rulers, it
was reported that he was only sleeping to awake in the hour of
his country&rsquo;s need. We know from Einhard (<i>Vita Karoli</i>, cap.
xxix.) that the Frankish heroic ballads were drawn up in writing
by Charlemagne&rsquo;s order, and it may be accepted as certain
that he was himself the subject of many such during his lifetime.
The legendary element crept even into the Latin panegyrics
produced by the court poets. Before the end of the 9th century
a monk of St Gall drew up a chronicle <i>De gestis Karoli Magni</i>,
which was based partly on oral tradition, received from an old
soldier named Adalbert, who had served in Charlemagne&rsquo;s
army. This recital contains various fabulous incidents. The
author relates a conversation between Otkar the Frank (Ogier
the Dane) and the Lombard king Desiderius (Didier) on the walls
of Pavia in view of Charlemagne&rsquo;s advancing army. To Didier&rsquo;s
repeated question &ldquo;Is this the emperor?&rdquo; Otkar continues
to answer &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; adding at last &ldquo;When thou shalt see
the fields bristling with an iron harvest, and the Po and the
Ticino swollen with sea-floods, inundating the walls of the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page895" id="page895"></a>895</span>
with iron billows, then shall Karl be nigh at hand.&rdquo; This episode,
which bears the marks of popular heroic poetry, may well be the
substance of a lost Carolingian <i>cantilena</i>.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The legendary Charlemagne and his warriors were endowed
with the great deeds of earlier kings and heroes of the Frankish
kingdom, for the romancers were not troubled by considerations
of chronology. National traditions extending over centuries were
grouped round Charlemagne, his father Pippin, and his son Louis.
The history of Charles Martel especially was absorbed in the
Charlemagne legend. But if Charles&rsquo;s name was associated
with the heroism of his predecessors he was credited with equal
readiness with the weaknesses of his successors. In the earlier
<i>chansons de geste</i> he is invariably a majestic figure and represents
within limitations the grandeur of the historic Charles. But in
the histories of the wars with his vassals he is often little more
than a tyrannical dotard, who is made to submit to gross insult.
This picture of affairs is drawn from later times, and the sympathies
of the poet are generally with the rebels against the
monarchy. Historical tradition was already dim when the
hypothetical and much discussed <i>cantilenae</i>, which may be taken
to have formed the repository of the national legends from the
8th to the 10th century, were succeeded in the 11th and the
early l2th centuries by the <i>chansons de geste</i>. The early poems
of the cycle sometimes contain curious information on the
Frankish methods in war, in council and in judicial procedure,
which had no parallels in contemporary institutions. The account
in the <i>Chanson de Roland</i> of the trial of Ganelon after the
battle of Roncesvalles must have been adopted almost intact from
earlier poets, and provides a striking example of the value of the
<i>chansons de geste</i> to the historian of manners and customs.
In general, however, the trouvère depicted the feeling and
manners of his own time.</p>

<p>Charlemagne&rsquo;s wars in Italy, Spain and Saxony formed part
of the common epic material, and there are references to his
wars against the Slavs; but especially he remained in the popular
mind as the great champion of Christianity against the creed
of Mahomet, and even his Norman and Saxon enemies became
Saracens in current legend. He is the Christian emperor directly
inspired by angels; his sword Joyeuse contained the point
of the lance used in the Passion; his standard was Romaine, the
banner of St Peter, which, as the oriflamme of Saint Denis, was
later to be borne in battle before the kings of France; and in
1164 Charles was canonized at the desire of the emperor Frederick
I. Barbarossa by the anti-pope Pascal III. This gave him no
real claim to saintship, but his festival was observed in some
places until comparatively recent times. Charlemagne was
endowed with the good and bad qualities of the epic king, and
as in the case of Agamemnon and Arthur, his exploits paled
beside those of his chief warriors. These were not originally
known as the twelve peers<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> famous in later Carolingian romance.
The twelve peers were in the first instance the companions in
arms of Roland in the Teutonic sense.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The idea of the paladins
forming an association corresponding to the Arthurian Round
Table first appears in the romance of <i>Fierabras</i>. The lists of
them are very various, but all include the names of Roland and
Oliver. The chief heroes who fought Charlemagne&rsquo;s battles
were Roland; Ganelon, afterwards the traitor; Turpin, the
fighting archbishop of Reims; Duke Naimes of Bavaria, the
wise counsellor who is always on the side of justice; Ogier
the Dane, the hero of a whole series of romances; and Guillaume
of Toulouse, the defender of Narbonne. Gradually most of the
<i>chansons de geste</i> were attached to the name of Charlemagne,
whose poetical history falls into three cycles:&mdash;the <i>geste du roi</i>,
relating his wars and the personal history of himself and his
family; the southern cycle, of which Guillaume de Toulouse is
the central figure; and the feudal epic, dealing with the revolts
of the barons against the emperor, the rebels being invariably
connected by the trouverès with the family of Doon de Mayence (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The earliest poems of the cycle are naturally the closest to
historical truth. The central point of the <i>geste du roi</i> is the
11th-century <i>Chanson de Roland</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roland, Legend of</a></span>), one of
the greatest of medieval poems. Strangely enough the defeat
of Roncesvalles, which so deeply impressed the popular mind,
has not a corresponding importance in real history. But it
chanced to find as its exponent a poet whose genius established
a model for his successors, and definitely fixed the type of later
heroic poems. The other early <i>chansons</i> to which reference is
made in <i>Roland&mdash;Aspremont, Enfances Ogier, Guiteclin, Balan</i>,
relating to Charlemagne&rsquo;s wars in Italy and Saxony&mdash;are not
preserved in their original form, and only the first in an early
recension. <i>Basin</i> or <i>Carl el Élégast</i> (preserved in Dutch and
Icelandic), the <i>Voyage de Charlemagne à Jerusalem</i> and <i>Le
Couronnement Looys</i> also belong to the heroic period. The purely
fictitious and romantic tales added to the personal history of
Charlemagne and his warriors in the 13th century are inferior
in manner, and belong to the decadence of romance. The old
tales, very much distorted in the 15th-century prose versions,
were to undergo still further degradation in 18th-century compilations.</p>

<p>According to <i>Berte aus grans piés</i>, in the 13th-century
<i>remaniement</i> of the Brabantine trouvère Adenès li Rois, Charlemagne
was the son of Pippin and of Berte, the daughter of Flore and
Blanchefleur, king and queen of Hungary. The tale bears marks
of high antiquity, and presents one of the few incidents in the
French cycle which may be referred to a mythic origin. On the
night of Berte&rsquo;s marriage a slave, Margiste, is substituted for
her, and reigns in her place for nine years, at the expiration of
which Blanchefleur exposes the deception; whereupon Berte is
restored from her refuge in the forest to her rightful place as
queen. <i>Mainet</i> (12th century) and the kindred poems in German
and Italian are perhaps based on the adventures of Charles
Martel, who after his father&rsquo;s death had to flee to the Ardennes.
They relate that, after the death of his parents, Charles was
driven by the machinations of the two sons of Margiste to take
refuge in Spain, where he accomplished his <i>enfances</i> (youthful
exploits) with the Mussulman king Galafre under the feigned
name of Mainet. He delivered Rome from the besieging Saracens,
and returned to France in triumph. But his wife Galienne,
daughter of Galafre, whom he had converted to the Christian
faith, died on her way to rejoin him. Charlemagne then made
an expedition to Italy (<i>Enfances Ogier</i> in the Venetian
<i>Charlemagne</i>, and the first part of the <i>Chevalerie Ogier de
Dannemarche</i> by Raimbert of Paris, 12th century) to raise the siege
of Rome, which was besieged by the Saracen emir Corsuble. He crossed
the Alps under the guidance of a white hart, miraculously sent
to assist the passage of the army. <i>Aspremont</i> (12th century)
describes a fictitious campaign against the Saracen King Agolant
in Calabria, and is chiefly devoted to the <i>enfances</i> of Roland.
The wars of Charlemagne with his vassals are described in
<i>Girart de Roussillon, Renaus de Montauban</i>, recounting the deeds
of the four sons of Aymon, <i>Huon de Bordeaux</i>, and in the latter
part of the <i>Chevalerie Ogier</i>, which belong properly to the cycle
connected with Doon of Mayence.</p>

<p>The account of the pilgrimage of Charlemagne and his twelve
paladins to the Holy Sepulchre must in its first form have been
earlier than the Crusades, as the patriarch asks the emperor to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page896" id="page896"></a>896</span>
free Spain, not the Holy Land, from the Saracens. The legend
probably originated in a desire to authenticate the relics in the
abbey of Saint Denis, supposed to have been brought to Aix by
Charlemagne, and is preserved in a 12th-century romance, <i>Le
Voyage de Charlemagne à Jerusalem et à Constantinople</i>.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> This
journey forms the subject of a window in the cathedral of
Chartres, and there was originally a similar one at Saint-Denis.
On the way home Charles and his paladins visited the emperor
Hugon at Constantinople, where they indulged in a series of
<i>gabs</i> which they were made to carry out. <i>Galien</i>, a favourite
15th-century romance, was attached to this episode, for Galien
was the son of the amours of Oliver with Jacqueline, Hugon&rsquo;s
daughter. The traditions of Charlemagne&rsquo;s fights with the
Norsemen (Norois, Noreins) are preserved in <i>Aiquin</i> (12th
century), which describes the emperor&rsquo;s reconquest of Armorica
from the &ldquo;Saracen&rdquo; king Aiquin, and a disaster at Cézembre
as terrible in its way as those of Roncesvalles and Aliscans. <i>La
destruction de Rome</i> is a 13th-century version of the older <i>chanson</i>
of the emir Balan, who collected an army in Spain and sailed to
Rome. The defenders were overpowered and the city destroyed
before the advent of Charlemagne, who, however, avenged the
disaster by a great battle in Spain. The romance of <i>Fierabras</i>
(13th century) was one of the most popular in the 15th century,
and by later additions came to have pretensions to be a complete
history of Charlemagne. The first part represents an episode
in Spain three years before Roncesvalles, in which Oliver defeats
the Saracen giant Fierabras in single combat, and converts him.
The hero of the second part is Gui de Bourgogne, who recovers
the relics of the Passion, lost in the siege of Rome. <i>Otinel</i> (13th
century) is also pure fiction. <i>L&rsquo;Entrée en Espagne</i>, preserved in
a 14th-century Italian compilation, relates the beginning of the
Spanish War, the siege of Pampeluna, and the legendary combat
of Roland with Ferragus. Charlemagne&rsquo;s march on Saragossa,
and the capture of Huesca, Barcelona and Girone, gave rise to
<i>La Prise de Pampelune</i> (14th century, based on a lost <i>chanson</i>);
and <i>Gui de Bourgogne</i> (12th century) tells how the children of the
barons, after appointing Guy as king of France, set out to find
and rescue their fathers, who are represented as having been
fighting in Spain for twenty-seven years. The <i>Chanson de Roland</i>
relates the historic defeat of Roncesvalles on the 15th of August
778, and forms the very crown of the whole Carolingian legend.
The two 13th-century romances, <i>Gaidon</i>, by Herbert Leduc
de Dammartin, and <i>Anséis de Carthage</i>, contain a purely fictitious
account of the end of the war in Spain, and of the establishment
of a Frankish kingdom under the rule of Anséis. Charlemagne
was recalled from Spain by the news of the outbreak of the
Saxons. The contest between Charlemagne and Widukind
(<i>Guiteclin</i>) offered abundant epic material. Unfortunately the
original <i>Guiteclin</i> is lost, but the legend is preserved in <i>Les
Saisnes</i> (c. 1300) of Jehan Bodel, which is largely occupied by
the loves of Baudouin and Sibille, the wife of Guiteclin. The
adventures of Blanchefleur, wife of Charlemagne, form a variation
of the common tale of the innocent wife falsely accused, and are told
in <i>Macaire</i> and in the extant fragments of <i>La Reine Sibille</i>
(14th century). After the conquest of the Saracens and the
Saxons, the defeat of the Northmen, and the suppression of the
feudal revolts, the emperor abdicated in favour of his son Louis
(<i>Le Couronnement Looys</i>, 12th century). Charles&rsquo;s harangue to his
son is in the best tradition of epic romance. The memory of
Roncesvalles haunts him on his death-bed, and at the moment
of death he has a vision of Roland.</p>

<p>The mythic element is practically lacking in the French
legends, but in Germany some part of the Odin myth was
associated with Charles&rsquo;s name. The constellation of the Great
Bear, generally associated with Odin, is Karlswagen in German,
and Charles&rsquo;s Wain in English. According to tradition in Hesse,
he awaits resurrection, probably symbolic of the triumph of the
sun over winter, within the Gudensberg (Hill of Odin). Bavarian
tradition asserts that he is seated in the Untersberg in a chair,
as in his tomb at Aix-la-Chapelle. His white beard goes on growing,
and when it has thrice encircled the stone table before him
the end of the world will come; or, according to another version,
Charles will arise and after fighting a great battle on the plain
of Wals will reign over a new Germany. There were medieval
chroniclers who did not fear to assert that Charles rose from
the dead to take part in the Crusades. In the MS. <i>Annales S.
Stephani Frisingenses</i> (15th century), which formerly belonged
to the abbey of Weihenstephan, and is now at Munich, the
childhood of Charlemagne is practically the same as that of many
mythic heroes. This work, generally known as the chronicle
of Weihenstephan, gives among other legends a curious history
of the emperor&rsquo;s passion for a dead woman, caused by a charm
given to Charles by a serpent to whom he had rendered justice.
The charm was finally dropped into a well at Aix, which
thenceforward became Charles&rsquo;s favourite residence. The story of
Roland&rsquo;s birth from the union of Charles with his sister Gilles,
also found in German and Scandinavian versions, has abundant
parallels in mythology, and was probably transferred from
mythology to Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The Latin chronicle, wrongly ascribed to Turpin (Tilpinus),
bishop of Reims from 753 to 800, was in reality later than
the earlier poems of the French cycle, and the first properly
authenticated mention of it is in 1165. Its primary object
was to authenticate the relics of St James at Compostella.
Alberic Trium Fontium, a monk of the Cistercian monastery of
Trois Fontanes in the diocese of Châlons, embodied much
poetical fiction in his chronicle (c. 1249). A large section of the
<i>Chronique rimée</i> (c. 1243) of Philippe Mousket is devoted to
Charlemagne&rsquo;s exploits. At the beginning of the 14th century
Girard of Amiens made a dull compilation known as <i>Charlemagne</i>
from the <i>chansons de gests</i>, authentic history and the pseudo-Turpin.
<i>La Conqueste que fit le grand roi Charlemaigne es Espaignes</i>
(pr. 1486) is the same work as the prose compilation of <i>Fierabras</i>
(pr. 1478), and Caxton&rsquo;s <i>Lyf of Charles the Grete</i> (1485).</p>

<p>The Charlemagne legend was fully developed in Italy, where it
was to have later a great poetic development at the hands of
Boiardo, Ariosto and Tasso. There are two important Italian
compilations, MS. XIII. of the library of St Mark, Venice
(c. 1200), and the <i>Reali di Francia</i> (c. 1400) of a Florentine
writer, Andrea da Barberino (b. 1370), edited by G. Vandelli
(Bologna, 1892). The six books of this work are rivalled in
importance by the ten branches of the Norse <i>Karlamagnus saga</i>,
written under the reign of Haakon V. This forms a consecutive
legendary history of Charles, and is apparently based on earlier
versions of the French Charlemagne poems than those which
we possess. It thus furnishes a guide to the older forms of
stories, and moreover preserves the substance of others which
have not survived in their French form. A popular abridgment,
the <i>Keiser Karl Magnus Krönike</i> (pr. Malmõ, 1534), drawn up
in Danish, serves in some cases to complete the earlier work.
The 2000 lines of the German <i>Kaiserchronik</i> on the history of
Charlemagne belong to the first half of the 12th century, and
were perhaps the work of Conrad, the poet of the <i>Ruolantes
Liet</i>. The German poet known as the Stricker used the
same sources as the author of the chronicle of Weihenstephan
for his <i>Karl</i> (c. 1230). The earliest important Spanish
version was the <i>Chronica Hispaniae</i> (c. 1284) of Rodrigo de
Toledo.</p>

<p>The French and Norman-French chansons circulated as freely
in England as in France, and it was therefore not until the period
of decadence that English versions were made. The English
metrical romances of Charlemagne are:&mdash;<i>Rowlandes Song</i> (15th
century); <i>The Taill of Rauf Coilyear</i> (c. 1475, pr. by R.
Lekpreuik, St Andrews, 1472), apparently original; <i>Sir Ferumbras</i>
(c. 1380) and the <i>Sowdone of Babylone</i> (c. 1400) from an early
version of <i>Fierabras</i>; a fragmentary <i>Roland and Vernagu</i>
(Ferragus); two versions of <i>Otuel</i> (Otinel); and a <i>Sege of
Melayne</i> (c. 1390), forming a prologue to Otinel unknown in French.</p>

and written in the vernacular has been thought to be discernible
under its Latin translation in the description of a siege
during  Charlemagne&rsquo;s  war  against  the  Saracens,   known as  the
&ldquo;Fragment from the Hague&rdquo; (Pertz, <i>Script.</i> iii. pp. 708-710).</p>

<p><a name="ft2a" id="ft2a" href="#fa2a"><span class="fn">2</span></a> The words <i>douze pairs</i> were anglicized in a variety of forms
ranging from douzepers to dosepers. The word even occurred as a
singular in the metrical romance of <i>Octavian</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;Ferst they sent
out a doseper.&rdquo; At the beginning of the 13th century there existed a
<i>cour des pairs</i> which exercised judicial functions and dated possibly
from the 11th century, but their prerogatives at the beginning of the
14th century appear to have been mainly ceremonial and decorative.
In 1257 the twelve peers were the chiefs of the great feudal provinces,
the dukes of Normandy, Burgundy and Aquitaine, the counts of
Toulouse, Champagne and Flanders, and six spiritual peers, the
archbishop of  Reims,  the bishops of   Laon,   Châlons-sur-Marne,
Beauvais, Langres and Noyon. (See Du Cange, <i>Glossarium</i>, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Par.&rdquo;).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLEMAGNE, JEAN ARMAND<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (1753-1838), French
dramatic author, was born at Bourget (Seine) on the 30th of
November 1753. Originally intended for the church, he turned
first to being a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk and then a soldier. He served in
the American War of Independence, and on returning to France
(1783) began to employ his pen on economic subjects, and later
in writing for the stage. He became the author of a large number
of plays, poems and romances, among which may be mentioned
the comedies <i>M. de Crac à Paris</i> (1793), <i>Le Souper des Jacobins</i>
(1795)and <i>L&rsquo;Agioteur</i> (1796) and <i>Observations de quelques patriotes
sur la nécessité de conserver les monuments de la littérature et des
arts</i> (1794), an essay written in collaboration with M.M. Chardin
and Renouard, which induced the Convention to protect books
adorned with the coats of arms of their former owners and other
treasures from destruction at the hands of the revolutionists.
He died in Paris on the 6th of March 1838.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLEMONT, JAMES CAULFEILD,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1728-1799),
Irish statesman, son of the 3rd viscount Charlemont, was
born in Dublin on the 18th of August 1728, and succeeded his
father as 4th viscount in 1734. The title of Charlemont descended
from Sir Toby Caulfeild (1565-1627) of Oxfordshire, England,
who was given lands in Ireland, and created Baron Charlemont
(the name of a fort on the Blackwater), for his services to King
James I. in 1620, and the 1st viscount was the 5th baron (d. 1671),
who was advanced by Charles II. Lord Charlemont is historically
interesting for his political connexion with Flood and Grattan;
he was a cultivated man with literary and artistic tastes, and both
in Dublin and in London his amiable character gave him considerable
social influence. For various early services in Ireland
he was made an earl in 1763, but he disregarded court favours and
cordially joined Grattan in 1780 in the assertion of Irish
independence. He was president of the volunteer convention in
Dublin in November 1783, having taken from the first a leading
part in the embodiment of the volunteers; and he was a strong
opponent of the proposals for the Union. He died on the 4th of
August 1799; his eldest son, who succeeded him, being subsequently
(1837) created an English baron.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLEROI<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (<i>Carolus Rex</i>), a town in the province of Hainaut,
Belgium. Pop. (1904) 26,528. It was founded in 1666 on the
site of a village called Charnoy by the Spanish governor Roderigo
and named after his sovereign Charles II. of Spain. Charleroi
is the centre of the iron industry of Belgium. It is connected by
a canal with Brussels, and from its position on the Sambre enjoys
facilities of communication by water with France as well as
Belgium. It was ceded soon after its foundation to France by
the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and Vauban fortified it. During
the French occupation the town was considerably extended, and
the fortifications were made so strong that Charleroi twice
successfully resisted the strenuous attacks of William of Orange.
In 1794 Charleroi again fell into the hands of the French, and on
this occasion instead of fortifying they dismantled it. In 1816
Charleroi was refortified under Wellington&rsquo;s direction, and it was
finally dismantled in 1859. Some portions of the old ramparts
are left near the railway station. There is an archaeological
museum with a miscellaneous collection of Roman and Frank antiquities.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span>.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> called <span class="sc">The Bald</span> (823-877), Roman emperor
and king of the West Franks, was the son of the emperor Louis
the Pious and of his second wife Judith and was born in 823.
The attempts made by his father to assign him a kingdom, first
Alamannia (829), then the country between the Meuse and the
Pyrenees (839), at the expense of his half-brothers Lothair and Louis
led to a rising on the part of these two (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Louis I.</a></span>, the Pious).
The death of the emperor in 840 was the signal for the outbreak
of war between his sons. Charles allied himself with his brother
Louis the German to resist the pretensions of the emperor Lothair,
and the two allies conquered him in the bloody victory of
Fontenoy-en-Puisaye (25 June 841). In the following year, the two brothers
confirmed their alliance by the celebrated oaths of Strassburg,
made by Charles in the Teutonic language spoken by the subjects
of Louis, and by Louis in the Romance tongue of Charles&rsquo;s
subjects. The war was brought to an end by the treaty of
Verdun (August 843), which gave to Charles the Bald the kingdom
of the western Franks, which practically corresponded with what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page898" id="page898"></a>898</span>
is now France, as far as the Meuse, the Saône and the Rhone,
with the addition of the Spanish March as far as the Ebro. The
first years of his reign up to the death of Lothair I. (855) were
comparatively peaceful, and during them was continued the
system of &ldquo;confraternal government&rdquo; of the sons of Louis the
Pious, who had various meetings with one another, at Coblenz
(848), at Meersen (851), and at Attigny (854). In 858 Louis the
German, summoned by the disaffected nobles, invaded the kingdom
of Charles, who fled to Burgundy, and was only saved by
the help of the bishops, and by the fidelity of the family of the
Welfs, who were related to Judith. In 860 he in his turn tried to
seize the kingdom of his nephew, Charles of Provence, but met
with a repulse. On the death of Lothair II. in 869 he tried to
seize his dominions, but by the treaty of Mersen (870) was compelled
to share them with Louis the German. Besides this,
Charles had to struggle against the incessant rebellions in Aquitaine,
against the Bretons, whose revolt was led by their chief
Nomenoé and Erispoé, and who inflicted on the king the defeats
of Ballon (845) and Juvardeil (851), and especially against the
Normans, who devastated the country in the north of Gaul, the
valleys of the Seine and Loire, and even up to the borders of
Aquitaine. Charles was several times compelled to purchase
their retreat at a heavy price. He has been accused of being
incapable of resisting them, but we must take into account the
unwillingness of the nobles, who continually refused to join the
royal army; moreover, the Frankish army does not seem to have
been sufficiently accustomed to war to make any headway against
the pirates. At any rate, Charles led various expeditions against
the invaders, and tried to put a barrier in their way by having
fortified bridges built over all the rivers. In 875, after the death
of the emperor Louis II., Charles the Bald, supported by Pope
John VIII., descended into Italy, receiving the royal crown at
Pavia and the imperial crown at Rome (29th December). But
Louis the German, who was also a candidate for the succession of
Louis II., revenged himself for Charles&rsquo;s success by invading and
devastating his dominions. Charles was recalled to Gaul, and
after the death of Louis the German (28th August 876), in his
turn made an attempt to seize his kingdom, but at Andernach
met with a shameful defeat (8th October 876). In the meantime,
John VIII., who was menaced by the Saracens, was continually
urging him to come to Italy, and Charles, after having taken at
Quierzy the necessary measures for safeguarding the government
of his dominions in his absence, again crossed the Alps, but
this expedition had been received with small enthusiasm by the
nobles, and even by Boso, Charles&rsquo;s brother-in-law, who had been
entrusted by him with the government of Lombardy, and they
refused to come with their men to join the imperial army. At
the same time Carlo man, son of Louis the German, entered
northern Italy. Charles, ill and in great distress, started on his
way back to Gaul, and died while crossing the pass of the Mont
Cenis on the 5th or 6th of October 877. He was succeeded by his
son Louis the Stammerer, the child of Ermentrude, daughter of a
count of Orleans, whom he had married in 842, and who had died in
869. In 870 he had married Richilde, who was descended from a
noble family of Lorraine, but none of the children whom he had by
her played a part of any importance. Charles seems to have been
a prince of education and letters, a friend of the church, and
conscious of the support he could find in the episcopate against
his unruly nobles, for he chose his councillors for preference
from among the higher clergy, as in the case of Guenelon of Sens,
who betrayed him, or of Hincmar of Reims. But his character
and his reign have been judged very variously. The general
tendency seems to have been to accept too easily the accounts
of the chroniclers of the east Frankish kingdom, which are
favourable to Louis the German, and to accuse Charles of
cowardice and bad faith. He seems on the contrary not to have
lacked activity or decision.</p>

of Charles&rsquo;s reign is represented by the <i>Annales Bertiniani</i>, which

of the West Franks, was the youngest of the three sons of Louis
the German, and received from his father the kingdom of Swabia
(Alamannia). After the death of his two brothers in succession,
Carloman (881) and Louis the Young (882), he inherited the whole
of his father&rsquo;s dominions. In 880 he had helped his two cousins
in the west Frankish realm, Louis III. and Carloman, in their
struggle with the usurper Boso of Provence, but abandoned
them during the campaign in order to be crowned emperor at
Rome by Pope John VIII. (February 881). On his return he led
an expedition against the Norsemen of Friesland, who were
entrenched in their camp at Elsloo, but instead of engaging with
them he preferred to make terms and paid them tribute. In 884 the
death of Carloman brought into his possession the west Frankish
realm, and in 885 he got rid of his rival Hugh of Alsace, an
illegitimate son of Lothair II., taking him prisoner by treachery
and putting out his eyes. However, in spite of his six expeditions
into Italy, he did not succeed in pacifying the country, nor in
delivering it from the Saracens. He was equally unfortunate in
Gaul and in Germany against the Norsemen, who in 886-887
besieged Paris. The emperor appeared before the city with a
large army (October 886), but contented himself by treating with
them, buying the retreat of the invaders at the price of a heavy
ransom, and his permission for them to ravage Burgundy without
his interfering. On his return to Alamannia, however, the general
discontent showed itself openly and a conspiracy was formed
against him. He was first forced to dismiss his favourite, the
chancellor Liutward, bishop of Vercelli. The dissolution of his
marriage with the pious empress Richarde, in spite of her innocence
as proved by the judicial examination, alienated his nobles
still more from him. He was deposed by an assembly which met
at Frankfort or at Tribur (November 887), and died in poverty
at Neidingen on the Danube (18th January 888).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IV.<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (1316-1378), Roman emperor and king of
Bohemia, was the eldest son of John of Luxemburg, king of
Bohemia, and Elizabeth, sister of Wenceslas III., the last
Bohemian king of the Premyslides dynasty. He was born at
Prague on the 14th of May 1316, and in 1323 went to the court
of his uncle, Charles IV., king of France, and exchanged his
baptismal name of Wenceslas for that of Charles. He remained
for seven years in France, where he was well educated and learnt
five languages; and there he married Blanche, sister of King
Philip VI., the successor of Charles IV. In 1331 he gained some
experience of warfare in Italy with his father; and on his return
to Bohemia in 1333 he was made margrave of Moravia. Three
years later he undertook the government of Tirol on behalf of his
brother John Henry, and was soon actively concerned in a
struggle for the possession of this county. In consequence of an
alliance between his father and Pope Clement VI., the relentless
enemy of the emperor Louis IV., Charles was chosen German king
in opposition to Louis by some of the princes at Rense on the
11th of July 1346. As he had previously promised to be subservient
to Clement he made extensive concessions to the pope
in 1347. Confirming the papacy in the possession of wide
territories, he promised to annul the acts of Louis against
Clement, to take no part in Italian affairs, and to defend and
protect the church. Meanwhile he had accompanied his father
into France and had taken part in the battle of Crecy in August
1346, when John was killed and Charles escaped wounded from
the field. As king of Bohemia he returned to Germany, and
after being crowned German king at Bonn on the 26th of
November 1346, prepared to attack Louis. Hostilities were
interrupted by the death of the emperor in October 1347, and
Günther, count of Schwarzburg, who was chosen king by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page899" id="page899"></a>899</span>
partisans of Louis, soon abandoned the struggle. Charles,
having made good use of the difficulties of his opponents, was
recrowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 25th of July 1349, and was
soon the undisputed ruler of Germany. Gifts or promises had
won the support of the Rhenish and Swabian towns; a marriage
alliance secured the friendship of the Habsburgs; and that of
Rudolph II., count palatine of the Rhine, was obtained when
Charles, who had become a widower in 1348, married his daughter
Anna.</p>

<p>In 1350 the king was visited at Prague by Cola di Rienzi, who
urged him to go to Italy, where the poet Petrarch and the
citizens of Florence also implored his presence. Turning a deaf
ear to these entreaties, Charles kept Rienzi in prison for a year,
and then handed him as a prisoner to Clement at Avignon.
Four years later, however, he crossed the Alps without an army,
received the Lombard crown at Milan on the 6th of January
1355, and was crowned emperor at Rome by a cardinal on the
5th of April in the same year. His sole object appears to have
been to obtain the imperial crown in peace, and in accordance
with a promise previously made to Pope Clement he only remained
in the city for a few hours, in spite of the expressed wishes of the
Romans. Having virtually abandoned all the imperial rights
in Italy, the emperor recrossed the Alps, pursued by the scornful
words of Petrarch but laden with considerable wealth. On his
return Charles was occupied with the administration of Germany,
then just recovering from the Black Death, and in 1356 he
promulgated the Golden Bull (<i>q.v.</i>) to regulate the election of
the king. Having given Moravia to one brother, John Henry,
and erected the county of Luxemburg into a duchy for another,
Wenceslas, he was unremitting in his efforts to secure other
territories as compensation and to strengthen the Bohemian
monarchy. To this end he purchased part of the upper Palatinate
of the Rhine in 1353, and in 1367 annexed Lower Lusatia to
Bohemia and bought numerous estates in various parts of
Germany. On the death in 1363 of Meinhard, duke of Upper
Bavaria and count of Tirol, Upper Bavaria was claimed by the
sons of the emperor Louis IV., and Tirol by Rudolph IV., duke
of Austria. Both claims were admitted by Charles on the
understanding that if these families died out both territories
should pass to the house of Luxemburg. About the same time
he was promised the succession to the margraviate of Brandenburg,
which he actually obtained for his son Wenceslas in 1373.
He also gained a considerable portion of Silesian territory,
partly by inheritance through his third wife, Anna, daughter of
Henry II., duke of Schweidnitz. In 1365 Charles visited Pope
Urban V. at Avignon and undertook to escort him to Rome;
and on the same occasion was crowned king of Burgundy, or
Arles, at Arles on the 4th of June 1365.</p>

<p>His second journey to Italy took place in 1368, when he had
a meeting with Urban at Viterbo, was besieged in his palace at
Siena, and left the country before the end of the year 1369.
During his later years the emperor took little part in German
affairs beyond securing the election of his son Wenceslas as king
of the Romans in 1376, and negotiating a peace between the
Swabian league and some nobles in 1378. After dividing his
lands between his three sons, he died on the 29th of November
1378 at Prague, where he was buried, and where a statue was
erected to his memory in 1848.</p>

<p>Charles, who according to the emperor Maximilian I. was
the step-father of the Empire, but the father of Bohemia, brought
the latter country to a high state of prosperity. He reformed
the finances, caused roads to be made, provided for greater
security to life and property, and introduced or encouraged
various forms of industry. In 1348 he founded the university
of Prague, and afterwards made this city the seat of an archbishop,
and beautified it by the erection of several fine buildings.
He was an accomplished diplomatist, possessed a penetrating
intellect, and was capable of much trickery in order to gain his
ends. By refusing to become entangled in Italian troubles and
confining himself to Bohemia, he proved that he preferred the
substance of power to its shadow. Apparently the most pliant
of men, he had in reality great persistence of character, and if
foiled in one set of plans readily turned round and reached his
goal by a totally different path. He was superstitious and peace-loving,
had few personal wants, and is described as a round-shouldered
man of medium height, with black hair and beard,
and sallow cheeks.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES V.<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (1500-1558), Roman emperor and (as <span class="sc">Charles I.</span>)
king of Spain, was born at Ghent on the 24th of February 1500.
His parents were Philip of Burgundy and Joanna, third child
of Ferdinand and Isabella. Philip died in 1506, and Charles
succeeded to his Netherland possessions and the county of
Burgundy (Franche Comté). His grandfather, the emperor
Maximilian, as regent, appointed his daughter Margaret vice-regent,
and under her strenuous guardianship Charles lived in
the Netherlands until the estates declared him of age in 1515.
In Castile, Ferdinand, king of Aragon, acted as regent for his
daughter Joanna, whose intellect was already clouded. On the
23rd of January 1516 Ferdinand died. Charles&rsquo;s visit to Spain
was delayed until the autumn of 1517, and only in 1518 was he
formally recognized as king conjointly with his mother, firstly
by the cortes of Castile, and then by those of Aragon. Joanna
lived to the very eve of her son&rsquo;s abdication, so that he was only
for some months technically sole king of Spain. During this
Spanish visit Maximilian died, and Charles succeeded to the
inheritance of the Habsburgs, to which was shortly added the
duchy of Württemberg. Maximilian had also intended that he
should succeed as emperor. In spite of the formidable rivalry of
Francis I. and the opposition of Pope Leo X., pecuniary corruption
and national feeling combined to secure his election in 1519.
Charles hurriedly left Spain, and after a visit to Henry VIII.
and his aunt Catherine, was crowned at Aix on the 23rd of
October 1520.</p>

<p>The difficulty of Charles&rsquo;s reign consists in the complexity of
interests caused by the unnatural aggregate of distinct territories
and races. The crown of Castile brought with it the two recently
conquered kingdoms of Navarre and Granada, together with
the new colonies in America and scattered possessions in northern
Africa. That of Aragon comprised the three distinct states of
Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia, and in addition the kingdoms
of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, each with a separate character
and constitution of its own. No less than eight independent
cortes or parliaments existed in this Spanish-Italian group,
adding greatly to the intricacy of government. In the Netherland
provinces again the tie was almost purely personal; there
existed only the rudiments of a central administration and a
common representative system, while the county of Burgundy
had a history apart. Much the same was true of the Habsburg
group of states, but Charles soon freed himself from direct
responsibility for their government by making them over,
together with Württemberg, to his brother Ferdinand. The
Empire entailed serious liabilities on its ruler without furnishing
any reliable assets: only through the cumbrous machinery of
the diet could Charles tap the military and financial resources of
Germany. His problem here was complicated by the growth of
Lutheranism, which he had to face at his very first diet in 1521.
In addition to such administrative difficulties Charles had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page900" id="page900"></a>900</span>
inherited a quarrel with France, to which the rivalry of Francis I.
for the Empire gave a personal character. Almost equally
formidable was the advance of Sultan Suliman up the Danube,
and the union of the Turkish naval power with that of the
Barbary States of northern Africa. Against Lutheran Germany
the Catholic emperor might hope to rely upon the pope, and
against France on England. But the attitude of the popes was
almost uniformly disagreeable, while from Henry VIII. and
Edward VI. Charles met with more unpleasantness than favour.</p>

<p>The difficulty of Charles himself is also that of the historian
and reader of his reign. It is probably more instructive to treat
it according to the emperor&rsquo;s several problems than in strict
chronological order. Yet an attempt to distinguish the several
periods of his career may serve as a useful introduction. The two
best dividing lines are, perhaps, the coronation as emperor at
Bologna in 1530, and the peace of Crépy in 1544. Until his visit
to Italy (1529) Charles remained in the background of the
European stage, except for his momentous meeting with Luther
at the diet of Worms (1521). This meeting in itself forms a
subdivision. Previously to this, during his nominal rule in the
Netherlands, his visit to Spain, and his candidature for the
Empire, he seemed, as it was said, spell-bound under the ferule
of his minister Chièvres. Almost every report represented him
as colourless, reserved and weak. His dependence on his Flemish
counsellors provoked the rising in Castile, the feebleness of his
government the social war in Aragon. The religious question
first gave him a living interest, and at this moment Chièvres died.
Aleander, the papal nuncio at Worms, now recognized that public
opinion had been wrong in its estimate of Charles. Never again
was he under tutelage. The necessity, however, of residence in
Spain prevented his taking a personal part in the great fight with
Francis I. for Italy. He could claim no credit for the capture of
his rival at Pavia. When his army sacked Rome and held Pope
Clement VII. prisoner, he could not have known where this
army was. And when later the French overran Naples, and
all but deprived him of his hold on Italy, he had to instruct his
generals that they must shift for themselves. The world had
become afraid of him, but knew little of his character. In the
second main division of his career Charles changed all this.
No monarch until Napoleon was so widely seen in Europe and in
Africa. Complexity of problems is the characteristic of this
period. At the head of his army Charles forced the Turks backwards
down the Danube (1532). He personally conquered Tunis
(1535), and was only prevented by &ldquo;act of God&rdquo; from winning
Algiers (1541). The invasion of Provence in 1536 was headed by
the emperor. In person he crushed the rebellion of Ghent (1540).
In his last war with Francis (1542-44) he journeyed from Spain to
the Netherlands, brought the rebellious duke of Cleves to his
knees, and was within easy reach of Paris when he made the peace
of Crépy (1544). In Germany, meanwhile, from the diet of Augsburg
(1530) onwards, he had presided at the diets or conferences,
which, as he hoped, would effect the reunion of the church.</p>

<p>Peace with France and the Turk and a short spell of friendliness
with Pope Paul III. enabled Charles at last to devote his whole
energies to the healing of religious schism. Conciliation proving
impossible, he led the army which received the submission of the
Lutheran states, and then captured the elector of Saxony at
Mühlberg, after which the other leader, Philip of Hesse, capitulated.
The Armed Diet of 1548 was the high-water mark of
Charles&rsquo;s power. Here, in defiance of the pope, he published the
Interim which was meant to reconcile the Lutherans with the
church, and the so-called Reform which was to amend its abuses.
During the next four years, owing to ill-health and loss of insight,
his power was ebbing. In 1552 he was flying over the Brenner
from Maurice of Saxony, a princeling whose fortunes he had
made. Once again the old complications had arisen. His old
enemy&rsquo;s son, Henry II., had attacked him indirectly in Piedmont
and Parma, and then directly in Germany in alliance with
Maurice. Once more the Turk was moving in the Danube and
in the western Mediterranean. The humiliation of his flight
gave Charles new spirit, and he once more led an army through
Germany against the French, only to be checked by the duke of
Guise&rsquo;s defence of Metz. Henceforth the waves of his fortune
plashed to and fro until his abdication without much ostensible
loss or gain.</p>

<p>Charles had abundance of good sense, but little creative genius,
and he was by nature conservative. Consequently he never
sought to impose any new or common principles of administration
on his several states. He took them as he found them, and
at most, as in the Netherlands, improved upon what he found.
So also in dealing with rival powers his policy may be called
opportunist. He was indeed accused by his enemies of emulating
Charlemagne, of aiming at universal empire. Historians have
frequently repeated this charge. Charles himself in later life
laughingly denied the imputation, and facts are in favour of his
denial. When Francis I. was in his power he made no attempt to
dismember France, in spite of his pledges to his allies Henry VIII.
and the duke of Bourbon. He did, indeed, demand the duchy
of Burgundy, because he believed this to have been unrighteously
stolen by Louis XI. from his grandmother when a helpless girl.
The claim was not pressed, and at the height of his fortunes in
1548 he advised his son never to surrender it, but also never to
make it a cause of war. When Clement VII. was his prisoner, he
was vehemently urged to overthrow the temporal power, to
restore imperial dominion in Italy, at least to make the papacy
harmless for the future. In reply he restored his enemy to the
whole of his dominions, even reimposing him by force on the
Florentine republic. To the end of his life his conscience was
sensitive as to Ferdinand&rsquo;s expulsion of the house of Albret from
Spanish Navarre, though this was essential to the safety of Spain.
Though always at war he was essentially a lover of peace, and all
his wars were virtually defensive. &ldquo;Not greedy of territory,&rdquo;
wrote Marcantonio Contarini in 1536, &ldquo;but most greedy of peace
and quiet.&rdquo; For peace he made sacrifices which angered his
hot-headed brother Ferdinand. He would not aid in expelling the
sultan&rsquo;s puppet Zapolya from Ferdinand&rsquo;s kingdom of Hungary,
and he suffered the restoration of the ruffianly duke of Württemberg,
to the grave prejudice of German Catholicism. In spite of
his protests, Henry VIII. with impunity ill-treated his aunt
Catherine, and the feeble government of Edward VI. bullied his
cousin Mary, who had been his fiancée. No serious efforts were
made to restore his brother-in-law, Christian II., to the throne of
Denmark, and he advised his son Philip to make friends with the
usurper. After the defeat of the Lutheran powers in 1547 he did
not gain a palm&rsquo;s breadth of territory for himself. He resisted
Ferdinand&rsquo;s claim for Wurttemberg, which the duke had deserved
to forfeit; he disliked his acceptance of the voluntary surrender
of the city of Constance; he would not have it said that he had
gone to war for the benefit of the house of Habsburg.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Charles V.&rsquo;s policy was not merely negative.
He enlarged upon the old Habsburg practice of marriage as a
means of alliance of influence. Previously to his election as
emperor, his sister Isabella was married to Christian II. of
Denmark, and the marriages of Mary and Ferdinand with the
king of Hungary and his sister had been arranged. Before he was
twenty Charles himself had been engaged some ten times with a
view to political combinations. Naturally, therefore, he regarded
his near relations as diplomatic assets. The federative system
was equally familiar; Germany, the Netherlands, and even Spain,
were in a measure federations. Combining these two principles, he
would within his more immediate spheres of influence strengthen
existing federations by intermarriage, while he hoped that the
same means would convert the jarring powers of Europe into a
happy family. He made it a condition of the treaty of Madrid
(1526) that Francis I. should marry his sister Eleanor, Manuel of
Portugal&rsquo;s widow, in the hope, not that she would be an ally or a
spy within the enemy&rsquo;s camp, but an instrument of peace. His
son&rsquo;s marriage with Mary Tudor would not only salve the rubs
with England, but give such absolute security to the Netherlands
that France would shrink from war. The personal union of all
the Iberian kingdoms under a single ruler had long been an aim of
Spanish statecraft. So Charles had married his sister Eleanor,
much against her will, to the old king Manuel, and then his sister
Catherine to his successor. The empress was a Portuguese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page901" id="page901"></a>901</span>
infanta, and Philip&rsquo;s first wife was another. It is thus small
wonder that, within a quarter of a century of Charles&rsquo;s death,
Philip became king of Portugal.</p>

<p>In the wars with Francis I. Italy was the stake. In spite of his
success Charles for long made no direct conquests. He would
convert the peninsula into a federation mainly matrimonial.
Savoy, the important buffer state, was detached from France by
the marriage of the somewhat feeble duke to Charles&rsquo;s capable
and devoted sister-in-law, Beatrice of Portugal. Milan,
conquered from France, was granted to Francesco Sforza, heir
of the old dynasty, and even after his treason was restored to
him. In the vain hope of offspring Charles sacrificed his niece,
Christina of Denmark, to the valetudinarian duke. In the long
negotiations for a Habsburg-Valois dynasty which followed
Francesco&rsquo;s death, Charles was probably sincere. He insisted
that his daughter or niece should marry the third rather than the
second son of Francis I., in order, apart from other reasons, to
run less risk of the duchy falling under French dominion. The
final investiture of Philip was forced upon him, and does not
represent his saner policy. The Medici of Florence, the Gonzaga
of Mantua, the papal house of Farnese, were all attached by
Habsburg marriages. The republics of Genoa and Siena were
drawn into the circle through the agency of their chief noble
families, the Doria and Piccolomini; while Charles behaved
with scrupulous moderation towards Venice in spite of her active
hostility before and after the League of Cognac. Occasional
acts of violence there were, such as the participation in the
murder of Pierluigi Farnese, and the measures which provoked
the rebellion of Siena. These were due to the difficulty of
controlling the imperial agents from a distance, and in part to
the faults of the victim prince and republic. On the whole, the
loose federation of viceroyalties and principalities harmonized
with Italian interests and traditions. The alternative was not
Italian independence, but French domination. At any rate,
Charles&rsquo;s structure was so durable that the French met with no
real success in Italy until the 18th century.</p>

<p>Germany offered a fine field for a creative intellect, since the
evils of her disintegration stood confessed. On the other hand,
princes and towns were so jealous of an increase of central
authority that Charles, at least until his victory over the League
of Schmalkalden, had little effective power. Owing to his wars
with French and Turks he was rarely in Germany, and his visits
were very short. His problem was infinitely complicated by the
union of Lutheranism and princely independence. He fell back
on the old policy of Maximilian, and strove to create a party by
personal alliances and intermarriage. In this he met with some
success. The friendship of the electors of Brandenburg, whether
Catholic or Protestant, was unbroken. In the war of Schmalkalden
half the Protestant princes were on Charles&rsquo;s side or
friendly neutrals. At the critical moment which preceded this,
the lately rebellious duke of Cleves and the heir of Bavaria
were secured through the agency of two of Ferdinand&rsquo;s invaluable
daughters. The relations, indeed, between the two old enemies,
Austria and Bavaria, were permanently improved. The elector
palatine, whose love affairs with his sister Eleanor Charles as a
boy had roughly broken, received in compensation a Danish
niece. Her sister, widow of Francesco Sforza, was utilized to
gain a hold upon the French dynasty which ruled Lorraine.
More than once there were proposals for winning the hostile
house of Saxony by matrimonial means. After his victory over
the League of Schmalkalden, Charles perhaps had really a chance
of making the imperial power a reality. But he lacked either
courage or imagination, contenting himself with proposals for
voluntary association on the lines of the defunct Swabian
League, and dropping even these when public opinion was against
them. Now, too, he made his great mistake in attempting to
foist Philip upon the Empire as Ferdinand&rsquo;s successor. Gossip
reported that Ferdinand himself was to be set aside, and careless
historians have given currency to this. Such an idea was
impossible. Charles wished Philip to succeed Ferdinand, while he
ultimately conceded that Ferdinand&rsquo;s son Maximilian should
follow Philip, and even in his lifetime exercise the practical
power in Germany. This scheme irritated Ferdinand and his
popular and ambitious son at the critical moment when it was
essential that the Habsburgs should hold together against
princely malcontents. Philip was imprudently introduced to
Germany, which had also just received a foretaste of the unpleasant
characteristics of Spanish troops. Yet the person rather
than the policy was, perhaps, at fault. It was natural that the
quasi-hereditary succession should revert to the elder line.
France proved her recuperative power by the occupation of
Savoy and of Metz, Toul and Verdun, the military keys of
Lorraine. The separation of the Empire and Spain left two
weakened powers not always at accord, and neither of them
permanently able to cope on equal terms with France. Nevertheless,
this scheme did contribute in no small measure to the
failure of Charles in Germany. The main cause was, of course,
the religious schism, but his treatment of this requires separate
consideration.</p>

<p>The characteristics of Charles&rsquo;s government, its mingled
conservatism and adaptability, are best seen in Spain and the
Netherlands, with which he was in closer personal contact than
with Italy and Germany. In Spain, when once he knew the
country, he never repeated the mistakes which on his first visit
caused the rising of the communes. The cortes of Castile were
regularly summoned, and though he would allow no encroachment
on the crown&rsquo;s prerogatives, he was equally scrupulous
in respecting their constitutional rights. They became, perhaps,
during the reign slightly more dependent on the crown. This
has been ascribed to the system of gratuities which in later reigns
became a scandal, but was not introduced by Charles, and as
yet amounted to little more than the payment of members&rsquo;
expenses. Indirectly, crown influence increased owing to the
greater control which had gradually been exercised over the
composition of the municipal councils, which often returned the
deputies for the cortes. Charles was throughout nervous as to
the power and wealth of the greater nobles. They rather than
the crown had conquered the communes, and in the past they
rather than the towns had been the enemies of monarchy. He
earnestly warned his son against giving them administrative
power, especially the duke of Alva, who in spite of his sanctimonious
and humble bearing cherished the highest ambitions:
in foreign affairs and war he might be freely used, for he was
Spain&rsquo;s best soldier. In the cortes of 1538 Charles came into
collision with the nobles as a class. They usually attended only
on ceremonial occasions, since they were exempted from direct
taxation, which was the main function of the cortes. Now,
however, they were summoned, because Charles was bent upon
a scheme of indirect taxation which would have affected all
classes. They offered an uncompromising opposition, and Charles
somewhat angrily dismissed them, nor did he ever summon
them again. The peculiar Spanish system of departmental
councils was further developed, so that it may be said that the
bureaucratic element was slightly increasing just as the parliamentary
element was on the wane. The evils of this tendency
were as yet scarcely apparent owing to Charles&rsquo;s personal intervention
in all departments. The councils presented their reports
through the minister chiefly concerned; Charles heard their
advice, and formed his own conclusions. He impressed upon
Philip that he should never become the servant of his ministers:
let him hear them all but decide himself. Naturally enough, he
was well served by his ministers, whom he very rarely changed.
After the death of the Piedmontese Gattinara he relied mainly on
Nicolas Perrenot de Granvella for Netherland and German
affairs, and on Francisco de los Cobos for Spanish, while the
younger Granvella was being trained. From 1520 to 1555 these
were the only ministers of high importance. Above all, Charles
never had a court favourite, and the only women who exercised
any influence were his natural advisers, his wife, his aunt Margaret
and his sister Mary. In all these ladies he was peculiarly fortunate.
Charles was never quite popular in Spain, but the empress
whom he married at his people&rsquo;s request was much beloved.
Complaints were made of his absenteeism, but until 1543 he
spent the greater portion of his reign in Spain, or on expeditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page902" id="page902"></a>902</span>
such as those against Tunis and Algiers which were distinctively
in Spanish interests. Spaniards disliked his Netherland and
German connexions, but without the vigorous blows which these
enabled him to strike at France, it is improbable that Spain
could have retained her hold on Italy, or her monopoly of
commerce with the Indies. The wars with Francis I. were, in
spite of the rival candidature for the Empire, Spanish wars
entailed by Ferdinand&rsquo;s retention of Roussillon, his annexation
of Navarre, his summary eviction of the French from Naples.
The Netherlands had become convinced on commercial grounds
of the wisdom of peace with France, and the German interest in
Milan was not sufficiently active to be a standing cause of war.
Charles and Francis had inherited the hostility of Ferdinand and
Louis XII.</p>

<p>The reign of Charles was in America the age of conquest and
organization. Upon his accession the settlements upon the
mainland were insignificant; by 1556 conquest was practically
complete, and civil and ecclesiastical government firmly established.
Actual expansion was the work of great adventurers
starting on their own impulse from the older colonies. To
Charles fell the task of encouraging such ventures, of controlling
the conquerors, of settling the relations between colonists and
natives, which involved those between the colonists and the
missionary colonial church. He must arrest depopulation,
provide for the labour market, regulate oceanic trade, and check
military preponderance by civil and ecclesiastical organization.
In America Charles took an unceasing interest; he had a boundless
belief in its possibilities, and a determination to safeguard
the interests of the crown. Cortes, Alvarado and the brothers
Pizarro were brought into close personal communication with
the emperor. If he bestowed on Cortes the confidence which the
loyal conqueror deserved, he showed the sternest determination
in crushing the rebellious and autonomous instincts of Almagro
and the Pizarros. But for this, Peru and Chile must have become
independent almost as soon as they were conquered. Throughout
he strove to protect the natives, to prevent actual slavery, and
the consequent raids upon the natives. Legislation was not,
indeed, always consistent, because the claims of the colonists
could not always be resisted, but on the whole he gave earnest
support to the missionaries, who upheld the cause of the natives
against the military, and sometimes the civil and ecclesiastical
elements. His humane care for his native subjects may well be
studied in the instructions sent to Philip from Germany in 1548,
when Charles was at the summit of his power.    If Charles had
had his will, he would have opened the colonial trade to the whole
of his wide possessions. The Castilians, however, jealously confined
it to the city of Seville, artificially fostering the indolence
of the colonists to maintain the agricultural and manufacturing
monopoly of Castile, and by extreme protective measures
forcing them to live on smuggled goods from other countries.
Charles did actually attempt to cure the exclusive interest of
the colonists in mineral wealth by the establishment of peasant
and artisan colonies. If in many respects he failed, yet the
organization of Spanish America and the survival of the native
races were perhaps the most permanent results of his reign. It
is a proof of the complexity of his interests that the march of the
Turk upon Vienna and of the French on Naples delayed until
the following reign the foundation of Spain&rsquo;s eastern empire.
Charles carefully organized the expedition of Magellan, which
sailed for the Moluccas and discovered the Philippines. Unfortunately,
his straits for money in 1529 compelled him to
mortgage to Portugal his disputed claim to the Moluccas, and the
Philippines consequently dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>If in the administration of Spain Charles did little more than
mark time, in the Netherlands advance was rapid. Of the seven
northern provinces he added five, containing more than half the
area of the later United Provinces. In the south he freed
Flanders and Artois from French suzerainty, annexed Tournai
and Cambrai, and closed the natural line of French advance
through the great bishopric of Liége by a line of fortresses across
its western frontier. Much was done to convert the aggregate
of jarring provinces into a harmonious unity by means of common
principles of law and finance, and by the creation of a national
army. While every province had its own assembly, there were
at Charles&rsquo;s accession only the rudiments of estates general
for the Netherlands at large. At the close of the reign the
common parliamentary system was in full swing, and was fast
converting the loosely knit provinces into a state. By these
means the ruler had wished to facilitate the process of supply,
but supply soon entailed redress, and the provinces could
recognize their common interests and grievances. Under Philip
II. all patriotic spirits passionately turned to this creation of
his father as the palladium of Netherland liberty. This process
of consolidation was infinitely difficult, and conflicts between
local and central authorities were frequent. That they were
safely tided over was due to Charles&rsquo;s moderation and his legal
mind, which prompted him to draw back when his case was bad.
The harshest act of his life was the punishment of the rebellion
of Ghent. Yet the city met with little or no sympathy in other
quarters, because she had refused to act in concert with the other
members of Flanders and the other provinces. It was no mere
local quarrel, but a breach of the growing national unity.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands Charles showed none of the jealousy with
which he regarded the Spanish nobles. He encouraged the
growth of large estates through primogeniture; he gave the
nobles the provincial governorships, the great court offices, the
command of the professional cavalry. In the Order of the Golden
Fleece and the long established presence of the court at Brussels,
he possessed advantages which he lacked in Spain. The nobility
were utilized as a link between the court and the provinces.
Very different was it with the church. By far the greater part
of the Netherlands fell under foreign sees, which were peculiarly
liable to papal exactions and to the intrigues of rival powers.
Thus the usual conflict between civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction
was peculiarly acute. To remedy this dualism of
authority and the consequent moral and religious abuses,
Charles early designed the creation of a national diocesan
system, and this was a darling project throughout his life.
He was doing what every German territorial prince, Catholic or
Lutheran, attempted, making bishoprics and abbeys dependent
on the crown, with nomination and institution in his hands,
and with reasonable control over taxation and jurisdiction.
The papacy unfortunately thwarted him, and the scheme,
which under Charles would have been carried with national
assent, and created a national church, took the appearance under
Philip of alien domination.</p>

<p>If in Germany Charles was emperor, he was in the Netherlands
territorial prince, and thus his interests might easily be at
disaccord with those of the Empire. Consequently, just as he had
shaken off French suzerainty from Flanders and Artois, so he
loosened the tie of the other provinces to Germany. In 1548
they were declared free and sovereign principalities not subject
to imperial laws, and all the territories were incorporated in the
Burgundian circle. It was, indeed, agreed that they should
contribute to imperial taxation, and in return receive imperial
protection. But this soon became a dead letter, and the Netherlands
were really severed from the Empire, save for the nominal
feudal tie in the case of some provinces. Thus some writers have
dated their independence from Charles&rsquo;s convention of 1548
rather than from the peace of Westphalia, a century later.
Having converted his heterogeneous territories into a self-sufficient
state, Charles often contemplated the formation of a
middle kingdom between France and Germany. At the last
moment he spoiled his own work by granting the Netherlands to
Philip. It was indeed hard to set aside the order of inheritance,
and the commercial interests of the provinces were closely bound
with Spain, and with England, whose queen Philip had married.
Under any other ruler than Philip the breach might not have
come so early. Yet it must be regretted that Charles had not
the courage of his convictions, and that he lost the opportunity
of completing the new nation which he had faithfully laboured to
create.</p>

<p>Charles V. is in the eyes of many the very picture of a Catholic
zealot. Popular opinion is probably mainly based upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page903" id="page903"></a>903</span>
letters written from Yuste in 1558, when two hot-beds of heresy
had been discovered in Spain herself, and on the contemporary
codicil to his will. These were, perhaps, really in part responsible
for the later persecution. Yet the circumstances were far from
being typical of the emperor&rsquo;s career. Death was very near
him; devotional exercises were his main occupation. The
letters, moreover, were cries of warning, and not edicts. Charles
was not then the responsible authority. There is a long step
between a violent letter and a violent act. Few men would
care to have their lives judged by letters written in the last
extremities of gout. Less pardonable was the earlier persecution
of the Valencian Moriscoes in 1525-1526. They had fought for
their landlords in the cause of order, had been forcibly converted
by the revolutionaries, and on the suppression of revolution had
naturally relapsed. But for this momentary conversion the
Inquisition would have had no hold upon them. The edict of
persecution was cruel and unnecessary, and all expert opinion in
Valencia was against it. It was not, however, actually enforced
until after the victory of Pavia. It seems likely that Charles
in a fit of religious exaltation regarded the persecution as a
sacrificial thank-offering for his miraculous preservation. It is
characteristic that, when in the following year he was brought
into personal contact with the Moors of Granada, he allowed
them to buy themselves off from the more obnoxious measures
of the Inquisition. Henceforth the reign was marked by extreme
leniency. Spain enjoyed a long lull in the activity of her Inquisition.
At Naples in 1547 a rumour that the Spanish
Inquisition was to be introduced to check the growth of heresy
in influential quarters produced a dangerous revolt. The
briefs were, however, issued by Paul III., no friend of Charles,
and when a Neapolitan deputation visited the emperor he disclaimed
any intention of making innovations. Of a different
type to all the above was the persecution in the Netherlands.
Here it was deliberate, chronic, and on an ascending scale.
It is not a sufficient explanation that heresy also was persistent,
ubiquitous and increasing, for this was also the case in Germany
where Charles&rsquo;s methods were neither uniform nor drastic. But
in the Netherlands the heretics were his immediate subjects,
and as in every other state, Catholic or Lutheran, they must
conform to their prince&rsquo;s religion. But there was more than this.
After the suppression of the German peasant revolt in 1525
many of the refugees found shelter in the teeming Netherland
cities, and heresy took the form, not of Lutheranism, but of
Anabaptism, which was believed to be perilous to society and
the state. The government put down Anabaptism, as a modern
government might stamp out Anarchism. The edicts were,
indeed, directed against heresy in general, and were as harsh
as they could be&mdash;at least on paper. Yet when Charles was
assured that they were embarrassing foreign trade he let it be
understood that they should not affect the foreign mercantile
communities. Prudential considerations proved frequently a
drag upon religious zeal.</p>

<p>The relations of Charles to heresy must be judged in the main
by his treatment of German Lutheranism. Here he had to deal,
not with drawing-room imprudences nor hole-and-corner conventicles,
not with oriental survivals nor millenary aspirations,
but with organized churches protected by their princes, supported
by revenues filched from his own church and stiffened by formulae
as rigid as those of Catholicism. The length and stubbornness of
the conflict will serve to show that Charles&rsquo;s religious conservatism
had a measure of elasticity, that he was not a bigot and
nothing more. It should be remembered that all his principal
ministers were inclined to be Erasmian or indifferent, that one of
his favourite confessors, Loaysa, advised compromise, and that
several intimate members of his court and chapel were, after his
death, victims of the Inquisition. The two more obvious courses
towards the restoration of Catholic unity were force and reconciliation,
in other words, a religious war or a general council.
Neither of these was a simple remedy. The latter was impossible
without papal concurrence, inoperative without the assistance of
the European powers, and merely irritant without the adhesion
of the Lutherans. It was most improbable that the papacy, the
powers and the Lutherans would combine in a measure so
palpably advantageous to the emperor. Force was hopeless
save in the absence of war with France and the Turk, and of
papal hostility in Italian territorial politics. Charles must obtain
subsidies from ecclesiastical sources, and the support of all German
Catholics, especially of the traditional rival, Bavaria. Even so
the Protestants would probably be the stronger, and therefore
they must be divided by utilizing any religious split, any class
distinction, any personal or traditional dislikes, or else by bribery.
Force and reconciliation seeming equally difficult, could an
alternative be found in toleration? The experiment might take
the form either of individual toleration, or of toleration for the
Lutheran states. The former would be equally objectionable
to Lutheran and Catholic princes as loosening their grip upon
their subjects. Territorial toleration might seem equally
obnoxious to the emperor, for its recognition would strengthen
the anti-imperial particularism so closely associated with
Lutheranism. If Charles could find no permanent specific, he
must apply a provisional palliative. It was absolutely necessary
to patch, if not to cure, because Germany must be pulled together
to resist French and Turks. Such palliatives were two&mdash;suspension
and comprehension. Suspension deferred the execution of
penalties incurred by heresy, either for a term of years, or until
a council should decide. Thus it recognized the divorce of the
two religions, but limited it by time. Comprehension instead of
recognizing the divorce would strive to conceal the breach. It
was a domestic remedy, German and national, not European and
papal. To become permanent it must receive the sanction of
pope and council, for the Roman emperor could not set up a
church of Germany. Yet the formula adopted might conceivably
be found to fall within the four corners of the faith, and so
obviate the necessity alike of force or council. Such were the
conditions of the emperor&rsquo;s task, and such the methods which he
actually pursued. He would advance now on one line, now on
another, now on two or three concurrently, but he never definitely
abandoned any. This fusion of obstinacy and versatility
was a marked feature of his character.</p>

<p>Suspension was of course often accidental and involuntary.
The two chief stages of Lutheran growth naturally corresponded
with the periods, each of nine years, when Charles was absent.
Deliberate suspension was usually a consequence of the failure
of comprehension. Thus at Augsburg in 1530 the wide gulf
between the Lutheran confession and the Catholic confutation
led to the definite suspensive treaty granted to the Lutherans at
Nuremberg (1532). Charles dared not employ the alternative
of force, because he needed their aid for the Turkish war. In
1541, after a series of religious conferences, he personally presented
a compromise in the so-called Book of Regensburg, which was
rejected by both parties. He then proposed that the articles
agreed upon should be compulsory, while on others toleration
should be exercised until a national council should decide. Never
before nor after did he go so far upon the path of toleration, or so
nearly accept a national settlement. He was then burning to set
sail for Algiers. His last formal suspensive measure was that of
Spires (Speyer) in 1544, when he was marching against Francis.
He promised a free and general council to be held in Germany,
and, as a preparation, a national religious congress. The
Lutherans were privately assured that a measure of comprehension
should be concluded with or without papal approval.
Meanwhile all edicts against heresy were suspended. No wonder
that Charles afterwards confessed that he could scarcely reconcile
these concessions with his conscience, but he won Lutheran aid
for his campaign. The peace of Crépy gave all the conditions
required for the employment of force. He had peace with French
and Turk, he won the active support of the pope, he had deeply
divided the Lutherans and reconciled Bavaria. Finding that the
Lutherans would not accept the council summoned by the pope to
Trent, he resorted to force, and force succeeded. At the Armed
Diet of 1548 reunion seemed within reach. But Paul III. in direct
opposition to Charles&rsquo;s wish had withdrawn the council from
Trent to Bologna. Charles could not force Lutherans to submit
to a council which he did not himself recognize, and he could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page904" id="page904"></a>904</span>
bring himself to national schism. Thus, falling back upon his old
palliatives, he issued the Interim and the accompanying Reform
of the Clergy, pending a final settlement by a satisfactory general
council. These measures pleased neither party, and Charles at
the very height of his power had failed. He was conscious of
failure, and made few attempts even to enforce the Interim.
Henceforward political complications gathered round him anew.
The only remedy was toleration in some form, independent of
the papacy and limitless in time. To this Charles could never
assent. His ideal was shattered, but it was a great ideal,
and the patience, the moderation, even at times the adroitness
with which he had striven towards it, proved him to be no
bigot.</p>

<p>The idea of abdication had long been present with Charles.
After his failure to eject the French from Metz he had not shrunk
from a wearisome campaign against Henry II., and he was now
tired out. His mother&rsquo;s death removed an obstacle, for there
could now be no question as to his son&rsquo;s succession to the Spanish
kingdoms. Religious settlement in Germany could no longer be
postponed, and he shrank from the responsibility; the hand that
should rend the seamless raiment of God&rsquo;s church must not be
his. To Ferdinand he gave his full authority as emperor, although
at his brother&rsquo;s earnest request formal abdication was delayed
until 1558. In the Hall of the Golden Fleece at Brussels on
the 25th of October 1555 he formally resigned to Philip the
sovereignty of his beloved Netherlands. Turning from his son to
the representatives of the estates he said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, you must
not be astonished if, old and feeble as I am in all my members,
and also from the love I bear you, I shed some tears.&rdquo; In the
Netherlands at least the love was reciprocal, and tears were
infectious among the thousand deputies who listened to their
sovereign&rsquo;s last speech. On the 16th of January 1556, Charles
resigned his Spanish kingdoms and that of Sicily, and shortly
afterwards his county of Burgundy. On the 17th of September
he sailed from Flushing on the last of his many voyages, an
English fleet from Portland bearing him company down the
Channel. In February 1557 he was installed in the home which he
had chosen at Yuste in Estremadura.</p>

<p>The excellent books which have been written upon the
emperor&rsquo;s retirement have inspired an interest out of all proportion
to its real significance. His little house was attached to
the monastery, but was not within it. He was neither an ascetic
nor a recluse. Gastronomic indiscretions still entailed their
inevitable penalties. Society was not confined to interchange of
civilities with the brethren. His relations, his chief friends, his
official historians, all found their way to Yuste. Couriers brought
news of Philip&rsquo;s war and peace with Pope Paul IV., of the victories
of Saint Quentin and Gravelines, of the French capture of Calais,
of the danger of Oran. As head of the family he intervened in the
delicate relations with the closely allied house of Portugal: he
even negotiated with the house of Navarre for reparation for the
wrong done by his grandfather Ferdinand, which appeared to
weigh upon his conscience. Above all he was shocked by the
discovery that Spain, his own court, and his very chapel were
infected with heresy. His violent letters to his son and daughter
recommending immediate persecution, his profession of regret at
having kept his word when Luther was in his power, have weighed
too heavily on his reputation. The feverish phrases of religious
exaltation due to broken health and unnatural retirement cannot
balance the deliberate humanity and honour of wholesome
manhood. Apart from such occasional moments of excitement,
the emperor&rsquo;s last years passed tranquilly enough. At first he
would shoot pigeons in the monastery woods, and till his last
illness tended his garden and his animal pets, or watched the
operations of Torriani, maker of clocks and mechanical toys.
After an illness of three weeks the call came in the early hours of
the feast of St Matthew, who, as his chaplain said, had for Christ&rsquo;s
sake forsaken wealth even as Charles had forsaken empire. The
dying man clasped his wife&rsquo;s crucifix to his breast till his fingers
lost their hold. The archbishop held it before his eyes, and with
the cry of &ldquo;<i>Ay Jesus!</i>&rdquo; died, in the words of his faithul squire
D. Luis de Quijada, &ldquo;the chief of men that had ever been or
would ever be.&rdquo; Posterity need not agree, but no great man can
boast a more honest panegyric.</p>

<p>In character Charles stands high among contemporary princes.
It consists of pairs of contrasts, but the better side is usually
stronger than the worse. Steadfast honesty of purpose was
occasionally warped by self-interest, or rather he was apt to
think that his own course must needs be that of righteousness.
Self-control would give way, but very rarely, to squalls of passion.
Obstinacy and irresolution were fairly balanced, the former
generally bearing upon ends, the latter upon means. His own
ideals were constant, but he could gradually assimilate the views
of others, and could bend to argument and circumstance; yet
even here he had a habit of harking back to earlier schemes
which he had seemed to have definitely abandoned. Intercourse
with different nationalities taught him a certain versatility; he
was dignified with Spaniards, familiar with Flemings, while the
material Italians were pleased with his good sense. His sympathies
were neither wide nor quick, but he was a most faithful
friend, and the most considerate of masters. For all who sought
him his courtesy and patience were unfailing. At his abdication
he dwelt with reasonable pride upon his labours and his journeyings.
Few monarchs have lived a more strenuous life. Yet his
industry was broken by fits of indolence, which were probably due
to health. In his prime his confessor warned him against this
defect, and it caused, indeed, the last great disaster of his life.
Fortunately he was conscious of his obstinacy, his irresolution
and his indolence. He would accept admonition from the chapter
of the Golden Fleece, would comment on his failings as a warning
to his son. When Cardinal Contarini politely assured him that
to hold fast to good opinions is not obstinacy but firmness,
the emperor replied, &ldquo;Ah! but I sometimes stick to bad ones.&rdquo;
Charles was not cruel, indeed the character of his reign was
peculiarly merciful. But he was somewhat unforgiving. He
especially resented any slight upon his honour, and his unwise
severity to Philip of Hesse was probably due to the unfounded
accusation that he had imprisoned him in violation of his pledge.
The excesses of his troops in Italy, in Guelders and on the
Austrian frontiers caused him acute pain, although he called himself
&ldquo;hard to weep.&rdquo; No great nobleman, statesman or financier
was executed at Charles&rsquo;s order. He was proud of his generalship,
classing himself with Alva and Montmorenci as the best of his
day. Yet his failures nearly balanced his successes. It is true
that in his most important campaign, that against the League
of Schmalkalden, the main credit must be ascribed to his well-judged
audacity at the opening, and his dogged persistency at
the close. As a soldier he must rank very high. It was said
that his being emperor lost to Spain the best light horseman of
her army. At every crisis he was admirably cool, setting a truly
royal example to his men. His mettle was displayed when he
was attacked on the burning sands of Tunis, when his troops
were driven in panic from Algiers, when in spite of physical
suffering he forded the Elbe at Mühlberg, and when he was
bombarded by the vastly superior Lutheran artillery under the
walls of Ingolstadt. When blamed for exposing himself on this
last occasion, &ldquo;I could not help it,&rdquo; he apologized; &ldquo;we were
short of hands, 1 could not set a bad example.&rdquo; Nevertheless
he was by nature timid. Just before this very action he had a
fit of trembling, and he was afraid of mice and spiders. The
force of his example was not confined to the field. Melanchthon
wrote from Augsburg in 1530 that he was a model of continence,
temperance and moderation, that the old domestic discipline
was now only preserved in the imperial household. He tenderly
loved his wife, whom he had married for pecuniary and diplomatic
reasons. Of his two well-known illegitimate children, Margaret
was born before he married, and Don John long after his wife&rsquo;s
death, but he felt this latter to be a child of shame. His sobriety
was frequently contrasted with the universal drunkenness of the
German and Flemish nobles, which he earnestly condemned.
But on his appetite he could place no control, in spite of the
ruinous effects of his gluttony upon his health. In dress, in his
household, and in his stable he was simple and economical.
He loved children, flowers, animals and birds. Professional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page905" id="page905"></a>905</span>
jesters amused him, and he was not above a joke himself. Maps
and mechanical inventions greatly interested him, and in later
life he became fond of reading. He takes his place indeed among
authors, for he dictated the commentaries on his own career.
Of music he possessed a really fine knowledge, and his high
appreciation of Titian proves the purity of his feeling for art.
The little collection of books and pictures which he carried to
Yuste is an index of his tastes. Charles was undeniably plain.
He confessed that he was by nature ugly, but that as artists
usually painted him uglier than he was, strangers on seeing him
were agreeably disappointed. The protruding lower jaw and
the thin pale face were redeemed by the fine open brow and
the bright speaking eyes. He was, moreover, well made, and
in youth had an incomparable leg. Above all no man could
doubt his dignity; Charles was every inch an emperor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES VI.<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (1685-1740), Roman emperor, was born on the
1st of October 1685 at Vienna. He was the second son of the
emperor Leopold I. by his third marriage with Eleanore, daughter
of Philip William of Neuburg, elector palatine of the Rhine.
When the Spanish branch of the house of Habsburg became
extinct in 1700, he was put forward as the lawful heir in opposition
to Philip V., the Bourbon to whom the Spanish dominions
had been left by the will of Charles II. of Spain. He was
proclaimed at Vienna on the 19th of September 1703, and made
his way to Spain by the Low Countries, England and Lisbon,
remaining in Spain till 1711, mostly in Catalonia, where the
Habsburg party was strong. Although he had a certain tenacity of
purpose, which he showed in later life, he displayed none of the
qualities required in a prince who had to gain his throne by the
sword (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spanish Succession, War of</a></span>). He was so afraid of
appearing to be ruled by a favourite that he would not take
good advice, but was easily earwigged by flatterers who played
on his weakness for appearing independent. In 1708 he was married
at Barcelona to Elizabeth Christina of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel
(1691-1750), a Lutheran princess who was persuaded
to accept Roman Catholicism by the assurances of
Protestant divines and of the philosopher Leibnitz, that she
could always give an Evangelical meaning to Catholic ceremonies.
On the death of his elder brother Joseph I. on the 17th of April
1711, Charles inherited the hereditary possessions of the house
of Habsburg, and their claims on the Empire. The death of
Joseph without male issue had been foreseen, and Charles had
at one time been prepared to give up Spain and the Indies on
condition that he was allowed to retain Naples, Sicily and the
Milanese. But when the case arose, his natural obstinacy led
him to declare that he would not think of surrendering any of
the rights of his family. It was with great difficulty that he
was persuaded to leave Spain, months after the death of his
brother (on the 27th of September 1711). Only the emphatic
refusal of the European powers to tolerate the reconstruction
of the empire of Charles V. forced him to give a sullen submission
to necessity. He abandoned Spain and was crowned emperor
in December 1711, but for a long time he would not recognize
Philip V. It is to his honour that he was very reluctant to
desert the Catalans who had fought for his cause. Some of their
chiefs followed him to Vienna, and their advice had an unfortunate
influence on his mind. They almost succeeded in
arousing his suspicions of the loyalty of Prince Eugene at the
very moment when the prince&rsquo;s splendid victories over the Turks
had led to the peace of Passarowitz on the 28th of July 1718, and
a great extension of the Austrian dominions eastward. Charles
showed an enlightened, though not always successful, interest
in the commercial prosperity of his subjects, but from the date
of his return to Germany till his death his ruling passion was to
secure his inheritance against dismemberment. As early as
1713 he had begun to prepare the &ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rdquo;
which was to regulate the succession. An only son, born on the
13th of April 1716, died in infancy, and it became the object of
his policy to obtain the recognition of his daughter Maria Theresa
as his heiress. He made great concessions to obtain his aim,
and embarked on complicated diplomatic negotiations. His
last days were embittered by a disastrous war with Turkey, in
which he lost almost all he had gained by the peace of Passarowitz.
He died at Vienna on the 20th of October 1740, and
with him expired the male line of his house. Charles VI. was
an admirable representative of the tenacious ambition of the
Habsburgs, and of their belief in their own &ldquo;august greatness&rdquo;
and boundless rights.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES VII.<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1697-1745), Roman emperor, known also as
Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria, was the son of the elector
Maximilian Emanuel and his second wife, Theresa Cunigunda,
daughter of John Sobieski, king of Poland. He was born on the
6th of August 1697. His father having taken the side of Louis
XIV. of France in the War of the Spanish Succession (<i>q.v.</i>),
Bavaria was occupied by the allies. Charles and his brother
Clement, afterwards archbishop of Cologne, were carried prisoners
to Vienna, and were educated by the Jesuits under the name of
the counts of Wittelsbach. When his father was restored to his
electorate, Charles was released, and in 1717 he led the Bavarian
contingent of the imperial army which served under Prince
Eugene against the Turks, and is said to have distinguished
himself at Belgrade. On the 25th of September 1722 he was
betrothed to Maria Amelia, the younger of the two orphan
daughters of the emperor Joseph I. Her uncle Charles VI.
insisted that the Bavarian house should recognize the Pragmatic
Sanction which established his daughter Maria Theresa as heiress
of the Habsburg dominions. They did so, but with secret protests
and mental reservations of their rights, which were designed to
render the recognition valueless. The electors of Bavaria had
claims on the possessions of the Habsburgs under the will of
the emperor Ferdinand I., who died in 1564.</p>

<p>Charles succeeded his father on the 26th of February 1726.
As a ruler of Bavaria, he showed a vague disposition to improve
the condition of his subjects, but his profuse habits and his efforts
to rival the splendour of the French court crippled his finances.
His policy was one of much duplicity, for he was constantly
endeavouring to keep on good terms with the emperor while
slipping out of his obligation to accept the Pragmatic Sanction
and intriguing to secure French support for his claims whenever
Charles VI. should die. On hearing of the emperor&rsquo;s last illness,
he ordered his agent at Vienna to renew his claim to the Austrian
inheritance. The claim was advanced immediately after the
death of Charles VI. on the 20th of October 1740. Charles Albert
now entered into the league against Maria Theresa, to the great
misfortune of himself and his subjects. By the help of her enemies
he was elected emperor in opposition to her husband Francis,
grand duke of Tuscany, on the 24th of January 1742, under the
title of Charles VII., and was crowned at Frankfort-on-Main
on the 12th of February. But as his army had been neglected,
he was utterly unable to resist the Austrian troops. While he was
being crowned his hereditary dominions in Bavaria were being
overrun. He described himself as attacked by stone and gout,
ill, without money or land, and in distress comparable to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page906" id="page906"></a>906</span>
sorrows of Job. During the War of the Austrian Succession
(<i>q.v.</i>) he was a mere puppet in the hands of the anti-Austrian
coalition, and was often in want of mere necessaries. In the
changes of the war he was able to re-enter his capital, Munich,
in 1743, but had immediately afterwards to take flight again.
He was restored by Frederick the Great in October 1744, but died
worn out at Munich on the 20th of January 1745.</p>

was created duke of Albany, and on the 16th of January 1605

daughter of Philip III. of Spain, had been for some time the
subject of negotiation, James desiring to obtain through Spanish
support the restitution of his son-in-law, Frederick, to the
Palatinate; and in 1623 Charles was persuaded by Buckingham,
who now obtained a complete ascendancy over him in opposition
to wiser advisers and the king&rsquo;s own wishes, to make a secret
expedition himself to Spain, put an end to all formalities, and
bring home his mistress himself: &ldquo;a gallant and brave thing
for his Highness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Steenie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Baby Charles,&rdquo; as James
called them, started on the 17th of February, arriving at Paris
on the 21st and at Madrid on the 7th of March, where they
assumed the unromantic names of Mr Smith, and Mr Brown.
They found the Spanish court by no means enthusiastic for the
marriage<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and the princess herself averse. The prince&rsquo;s immediate
conversion was expected, and a complete religious
tolerance for the Roman Catholics in England demanded. James
engaged to allow the infanta the right of public worship and to
use his influence to modify the law, but Charles himself went
much further. He promised the alteration of the penal laws
within three years, conceded the education of the children to
the mother till the age of twelve, and undertook to listen to the
infanta&rsquo;s priests in matters of religion, signing the marriage
contract on the 25th of July 1623. The Spanish, however, did
not trust to words, and Charles was informed that his wife could
only follow him to England when these promises were executed.
Moreover, they had no intention whatever of aiding the Protestant
Frederick. Meanwhile Buckingham, incensed at the failure of
the expedition, had quarrelled with the grandees, and Charles
left Madrid, landing at Portsmouth on the 5th of October, to the
joy of the people, to whom the proposed alliance was odious.
He now with Buckingham urged James to make war on Spain,
and in December 1624 signed a marriage treaty with Henrietta
Maria, daughter of Henry IV. of France. In April Charles had
declared solemnly to the parliament that in case of his marriage
to a Roman Catholic princess no concessions should be granted to
recusants, but these were in September 1624 deliberately promised
by James and Charles in a secret article, the first instance of the
duplicity and deception practised by Charles in dealing with the
parliament and the nation. The French on their side promised
to assist in Mansfeld&rsquo;s expedition for the recovery of the
Palatinate, but Louis in October refused to allow the men to pass
through France; and the army, without pay or provisions,
dwindled away in Holland to nothing.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March 1625 Charles I. succeeded to the throne
by the death of his father, and on the 1st of May he was married
by proxy to Henrietta Maria. He received her at Canterbury
on the 13th of June, and on the 18th his first parliament
assembled. On the day of his marriage Charles had given directions
that the prosecutions of the Roman Catholics should cease,
but he now declared his intention of enforcing the laws against
them, and demanded subsidies for carrying on the war against
Spain. The Commons, however, responded coldly. Charles had
lent ships to Louis XIII. to be used against the Protestants at
La Rochelle, and the Commons were not aware of the subterfuges
and fictitious delays intended to prevent their employment.
The Protestant feelings of the Commons were also aroused by the
king&rsquo;s support of the royal chaplain, Richard Montagu, who had
repudiated Calvinistic doctrine. They only voted small sums,
and sent up a petition on the state of religion and reflecting upon
Buckingham, whom they deemed responsible for the failure of
Mansfeld&rsquo;s expedition, at the same time demanding counsellors in
whom they could trust. Parliament was accordingly dissolved
by Charles on the 12th of August. He hoped that greater success
abroad would persuade the Commons to be more generous.
On the 8th of September 1625 he made the treaty of Southampton
with the Dutch against Spain, and sent an expedition to Cadiz
under Sir Edward Cecil, which, however, was a failure. In order to
make himself independent of parliament he attempted to raise
money on the crown jewels in Holland, and to diminish the
opposition in the Commons he excluded the chief leaders by
appointing them sheriffs. When the second parliament met,
however, on the 6th of February 1626, the opposition, led by Sir
John Eliot, was more determined than before, and their attack
was concentrated upon Buckingham. On the 29th of March,
Charles, calling the Commons into his presence, accused them of
leading him into the war and of taking advantage of his difficulties
to &ldquo;make their own game.&rdquo; &ldquo;I pray you not to be deceived,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;it is not a parliamentary way, nor &rsquo;tis not a way to deal
with a king. Remember that parliaments are altogether in my
power for their calling, sitting, and dissolution; therefore as I
find the fruits of them good or evil, they are to continue or not to
be.&rdquo; Charles, however, was worsted in several collisions with the
two houses, with a consequent loss of influence. He was obliged
by the peers to set at liberty Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel,
whom he had put into the Tower, and to send a summons to the
earl of Bristol, whom he had attempted to exclude from parliament,
while the Commons compelled him, with a threat of doing
no business, to liberate Eliot and Digges, the managers of Buckingham&rsquo;s
impeachment, whom he had imprisoned. Finally in June
the Commons answered Charles&rsquo;s demand for money by a remonstrance
asking for Buckingham&rsquo;s dismissal, which they
decided must precede the grant of supply. They claimed responsible
ministers, while Charles considered himself the executive
and the sole and unfettered judge of the necessities of the state.
Accordingly on the 15th Charles dissolved the parliament.</p>

<p>The king was now in great need of money. He was at war
with Spain and had promised to pay £30,000 a month to Christian
IV. of Denmark in support of the Protestant campaign in
Germany. To these necessities was now added a war with
France. Charles had never kept his promise concerning the
recusants; disputes arose in consequence with his wife, and on
the 31st of July 1626 he ordered all her French attendants to be
expelled from Whitehall and sent back to France. At the same
time several French ships carrying contraband goods to the
Spanish Netherlands were seized by English warships. On the
27th of June 1627 Buckingham with a large expedition sailed to
the Isle of Ré to relieve La Rochelle, then besieged by the forces
of Louis XIII. Though the success of the French Protestants was
an object much desired in England, Buckingham&rsquo;s unpopularity
prevented support being given to the expedition, and the duke
returned to Plymouth on the 11th of November completely
defeated. Meanwhile Charles had endeavoured to get the money
refused to him by parliament by means of a forced loan, dismissing
Chief Justice Crewe for declining to support its legality,
and imprisoning several of the leaders of the opposition for refusing
to subscribe to it. These summary measures, however,
only brought a small sum into the treasury. On the 2nd of
January 1628 Charles ordered the release of all the persons
imprisoned, and on the 17th of March summoned his third
parliament.</p>

<p>Instead of relieving the king&rsquo;s necessities the Commons immediately
proceeded to discuss the constitutional position and
to formulate the Petition of Right, forbidding taxation without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page907" id="page907"></a>907</span>
consent of parliament, arbitrary and illegal imprisonment,
compulsory billeting in private houses, and martial law. Charles,
on the 1st of May, first demanded that they should &ldquo;rest on his
royal word and promise.&rdquo; He obtained an opinion from the
judges that the acceptance of the petition would not absolutely
preclude in certain cases imprisonments without showing cause,
and after a futile endeavour to avoid an acceptance by returning
an ambiguous answer which only exasperated the Commons, he
gave his consent on the 7th of June in the full and usual form.
Charles now obtained his subsidies, but no real settlement was
reached, and his relations with the parliament remained as
unfriendly as before. They proceeded to remonstrate against his
government and against his support of Buckingham, and denied
his right to tonnage and poundage. Accordingly, on the 26th of
June they were prorogued. New disasters befell Charles, in the
assassination of Buckingham and in the failure of the fresh
expedition sent to Ré. In January 1629 the parliament reassembled,
irritated by the exaction of the duties and seizure of
goods during the interval, and suspicious of &ldquo;innovations in
religion,&rdquo; the king having forbidden the clergy to continue
the controversy concerning Calvinistic and Arminian doctrines,
the latter of which the parliament desired to suppress. While
they were discussing these matters, on the 2nd of March 1629,
the king ordered them to adjourn, but amidst a scene of great
excitement the speaker, Sir John Finch, was held down in his
chair and the doors were locked, whilst resolutions against innovations
in religion and declaring those who levied or paid tonnage and
poundage enemies to their country were passed. Parliament was
immediately dissolved, and Charles imprisoned nine members,
leaders of the opposition, Eliot, Holles, Strode, Selden, Valentine,
Coryton, Heyman, Hobart and Long, his vengeance being especially
shown in the case of Eliot, the most formidable of his
opponents, who died in the Tower of consumption after long
years of close and unhealthy confinement, and whose corpse even
Charles refused to give up to his family.</p>

<p>For eleven years Charles ruled without parliaments and with
some success. There seemed no reason to think that &ldquo;that
noise,&rdquo; to use Laud&rsquo;s expression concerning parliaments, would
ever be heard again by those then living. A revenue of about
£618,000 was obtained by enforcing the payment of tonnage and
poundage, and while avoiding the taxes, loans, and benevolences
forbidden by the petition of right, by monopolies, fines for
knighthood, and for pretended encroachments on the royal
domains and forests, which enabled the king to meet expenditure
at home. In Ireland, Charles, in order to get money, had granted
the Graces in 1628, conceding security of titles of more than
sixty years&rsquo; standing, and a more moderate oath of allegiance for
the Roman Catholics, together with the renunciation of the shilling
fine for non-attendance at church. He continued, however, to
make various attempts to get estates into his possession on the
pretext of invalid title, and on the 12th of May 1635 the city of
London estates were sequestered. Charles here destroyed one of
the most valuable settlements in Ireland founded by James I.
in the interests of national defence, and at the same time extinguished
the historic loyalty of the city of London, which
henceforth steadily favoured the parliamentary cause. In 1633
Wentworth had been sent to Ireland to establish a medieval
monarchy and get money, and his success in organization seemed
great enough to justify the attempt to extend the system to
England. Charles at the same time restricted his foreign policy
to scarcely more than a wish for the recovery of the Palatinate, to
further which he engaged in a series of numerous and mutually
destructive negotiations with Gustavus Adolphus and with
Spain, finally making peace with Spain on the 5th of November
1630, an agreement which was followed on the 2nd of January
1631 by a further secret treaty, the two kings binding themselves
to make war on the Dutch and partition their territories. A
notable feature of this agreement was that while in Charles&rsquo;s
portion Roman Catholicism was to be tolerated, there was no
guarantee for the security of Protestantism in the territory to be
ceded to Spain.</p>

<p>In 1634 Charles levied ship-money from the seaport towns for
the increase of the navy, and in 1635 the tax was extended to
the inland counties, which aroused considerable opposition. In
February 1637 Charles obtained an opinion in favour of his claims
from the judges, and in 1638 the great Hampden case was decided
in his favour. The apparent success, however, of Charles was
imperilled by the general and growing resentment aroused by his
exactions and whole policy, and this again was small compared
with the fears excited by the king&rsquo;s attitude towards religion and
Protestantism. He supported zealously Laud&rsquo;s rigid Anglican
orthodoxy, his compulsory introduction of unwelcome ritual, and
his narrow, intolerant and despotic policy, which was marked by
several savage prosecutions and sentences in the Star Chamber,
drove numbers of moderate Protestants out of the Church into
Presbyterianism, and created an intense feeling of hostility to the
government throughout the country. Charles further increased
the popular fears on the subject of religion by his welcome given to
Panzani, the pope&rsquo;s agent, in 1634, who endeavoured unsuccessfully
to reconcile the two churches, and afterwards to George
Conn, papal agent at the court of Henrietta Maria, while the
favour shown by the king to these was contrasted with the severe
sentences passed upon the Puritans.</p>

<p>The same imprudent neglect of the national sentiment was
pursued in Scotland. Charles had already made powerful
enemies there by a declaration announcing the arbitrary revocation
of former church estates to the crown. On the 18th of June
1633 he was crowned at Edinburgh with full Anglican ceremonial,
which lost him the hearts of numbers of his Scottish subjects and
aroused hostility to his government in parliament. After his
return to England he gave further offence by ordering the use
of the surplice, by his appointment of Archbishop Spotiswood
as chancellor of Scotland, and by introducing other bishops into
the privy council. In 1636 the new <i>Book of Canons</i> was issued
by the king&rsquo;s authority, ordering the communion table to be
placed at the east end, enjoining confession, and declaring
excommunicate any who should presume to attack the new
prayer-book. The latter was ordered to be used on the 18th of
October 1636, but it did not arrive in Scotland till May 1637.
It was intensely disliked both as &ldquo;popish&rdquo; and as English.
A riot followed its first use in St Giles&rsquo; cathedral on the 23rd of
July, and Charles&rsquo;s order to enforce it on the 10th of September
was met by fresh disturbances and by the establishment of
the &ldquo;Tables,&rdquo; national committees which now became the real
though informal government of Scotland. In 1638 the national
covenant was drawn up, binding those that signed it to defend
their religion to the death, and was taken by large numbers
with enthusiasm all over the country. Charles now drew back,
promised to enforce the canons and prayer-book only in a &ldquo;fair
and legal way,&rdquo; and sent the marquis of Hamilton as a mediator.
The latter, however, a weak and incapable man, desirous of
popularity with all parties, and unfaithful to the king&rsquo;s interests,
yielded everything, without obtaining the return of Charles&rsquo;s
subjects to their allegiance. The assembly met at Glasgow on
the 21st of November, and in spite of Hamilton&rsquo;s opposition
immediately proceeded to judge the bishops. On the 28th
Hamilton dissolved it, but it continued to sit, deposed the bishops
and re-established Presbyterianism. The rebellion had now
begun, and an appeal to arms alone could decide the quarrel
between Charles and his subjects. On the 28th of May 1639
he arrived at Berwick with a small and ill-trained force, thus
beginning what is known as the first Bishops&rsquo; War; but being
confronted by the Scottish army at Duns Law, he was compelled
to sign the treaty of Berwick on the 18th of June, which provided
for the disbandment of both armies and the restitution to the
king of the royal castles, referring all questions to a general
assembly and a parliament. When the assembly met it abolished
episcopacy, but Charles, who on the 3rd of August had returned
to Whitehall, refused his consent to this and to other measures
proposed by the Scottish parliament. His extreme financial
necessities, and the prospect of renewed hostilities with the Scots,
now moved Charles, at the instigation of Strafford, who in
September had left Ireland to become the king&rsquo;s chief adviser,
to turn again to parliament for assistance as the last resource,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page908" id="page908"></a>908</span>
and on the 13th of April 1640 the Short Parliament assembled.
But on its discussing grievances before granting supplies and
finally refusing subsidies till peace was made with the Scots, it
was dissolved on the 5th of May. Charles returned once more
to measures of repression, and on the 10th imprisoned some of
the London aldermen who refused to lend money. He prepared
for war, scraping together what money he could and obtaining
a grant through Strafford from Ireland. His position, however,
was hopeless; his forces were totally undisciplined, and the
Scots were supported by the parliamentary opposition in England.
On the 20th of August the Scots crossed the Tweed, beginning
the so-called second Bishops&rsquo; War, defeated the king&rsquo;s army
at Newburn on the 28th, and subsequently occupied Newcastle
and Durham. Charles at this juncture, on the 24th of September,
summoned a great council of the peers; and on the 21st of
October a cessation of arms was agreed to by the treaty of Ripon,
the Scots receiving £850 a day for the maintenance of the army,
and further negotiations being transferred to London. On the
3rd of November the king summoned the Long Parliament.</p>

<p>Such was the final issue of Charles&rsquo;s attempt to govern without
parliaments&mdash;Scotland in triumphant rebellion, Ireland only
waiting for a signal to rise, and in England the parliament revived
with almost irresistible strength, in spite of the king, by the force
of circumstances alone. At this great crisis, which would indeed
have taxed the resolution and resource of the most cool-headed
and sagacious statesman, Charles failed signally. Two alternative
courses were open to him, either of which still offered good
chances of success. He might have taken his stand on the ancient
and undoubted prerogative of the crown, resisted all encroachments
on the executive by the parliament by legal and constitutional
means, which were probably ample, and in case of
necessity have appealed to the loyalty of the nation to support
him in arms; or he might have waived his rights, and, acknowledging
the mistakes of his past administration, have united
with the parliament and created once more that union of interests
and sentiment of the monarchy with the nation which had made
England so powerful. Charles, however, pretended to do both
simultaneously or by turns, and therefore accomplished neither.
The illegally imprisoned members of the last parliament, now
smarting with the sense of their wrongs, were set free to stimulate
the violence of the opposition to the king in the new assembly.
Of Charles&rsquo;s double statecraft, however, the series of incidents
which terminated the career of the great Strafford form the most
terrible example. Strafford had come to London in November,
having been assured by Charles that he &ldquo;should not suffer in his
person, honour or fortune,&rdquo; but was impeached and thrown into
the Tower almost immediately. Charles took no steps to hinder
the progress of the proceedings against him, but entered into
schemes for saving him by bringing up an army to London, and
this step exasperated Strafford&rsquo;s enemies and added new zeal to
the prosecution. On the 23rd of April, after the passing of the
attainder by the Commons, he repeated to Strafford his former
assurances of protection. On the 1st of May he appealed to
the Lords to spare his life and be satisfied with rendering him
incapable of holding office. On the 2nd he made an attempt
to seize the Tower by force. On the 10th, yielding to the
queen&rsquo;s fears and to the mob surging round his palace, he signed
his death-warrant. &ldquo;If my own person only were in danger,&rdquo; he
declared to the council, &ldquo;I would gladly venture it to save my
Lord Strafford&rsquo;s life; but seeing my wife, children, all my
kingdom are concerned in it, I am forced to give way unto it.&rdquo;
On the 11th he sent to the peers a petition for Strafford&rsquo;s life,
the force of which was completely annulled by the strange postscript:
&ldquo;If he must die, it were a charity to reprieve him until
Saturday.&rdquo; This tragic surrender of his great and devoted
servant left an indelible stain upon the king&rsquo;s character, and he
lived to repent it bitterly. One of his last admonitions to the
prince of Wales was &ldquo;never to give way to the punishment
of any for their faithful service to the crown.&rdquo; It was regarded
by Charles as the cause of his own subsequent misfortunes,
and on the scaffold the remembrance of it disturbed his own last
moments. The surrender of Strafford was followed by another
stupendous concession by Charles, the surrender of his right
to dissolve the parliament without its own consent, and the parliament
immediately proceeded, with Charles&rsquo;s consent, to sweep
away the star-chamber, high commission and other extra-legal
courts, and all extra-parliamentary taxation. Charles, however,
did not remain long or consistently in the yielding mood. In
June 1641 he engaged in a second army plot for bringing up the
forces to London, and on the 10th of August he set out for
Scotland in order to obtain the Scottish army against the
parliament in England; this plan was obviously doomed to
failure and was interrupted by another appeal to force, the so-called
Incident, at which Charles was suspected (in all probability
unjustly) of having connived, consisting in an attempt
to kidnap and murder Argyll, Hamilton and Lanark, with whom
he was negotiating. Charles had also apparently been intriguing
with Irish Roman Catholic lords for military help in return
for concessions, and he was suspected of complicity in the Irish
rebellion which now broke out. He left Scotland more discredited
than ever, having by his concessions made, to use
Hyde&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;a perfect deed of gift of that kingdom,&rdquo; and
without gaining any advantage.</p>

<p>Charles returned to London on the 25th of November 1641 and
was immediately confronted by the Grand Remonstrance
(passed on the 22nd), in which, after reciting the chief points of the
king&rsquo;s misgovernment, the parliament demanded the appointment
of acceptable ministers and the constitution of an assembly
of divines to settle the religious question. On the 2nd of January
1642 Charles gave office to the opposition members Colepeper
and Falkland, and at the same time Hyde left the opposition
party to serve the king. Charles promised to take no serious
step without their advice. Nevertheless, entirely without their
knowledge, through the influence of the queen whose impeachment
was intended, Charles on the 4th made the rash and fatal
attempt to seize with an armed force the five members of the
Commons, Pym, Hampden, Holies, Hesilrige and Strode, whom,
together with Mandeville (afterwards earl of Manchester) in the
Lords, he had impeached of high treason. No English sovereign
ever had (or has since that time) penetrated into the House of
Commons. So complete and flagrant a violation of parliamentary
liberties, and an appeal so crude and glaring to brute force, could
only be justified by complete success; but the court plans had
been betrayed, and were known to the offending members, who,
by order of the House, had taken refuge in the city before the
king&rsquo;s arrival with the soldiers. Charles, on entering the House,
found &ldquo;the birds flown,&rdquo; and returned baffled, having thrown
away the last chance of a peaceful settlement (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lenthall,
William</a></span>). The next day Charles was equally unsuccessful in
obtaining their surrender in the city. &ldquo;The king had the worst
day in London yesterday,&rdquo; wrote a spectator of the scene, &ldquo;that
ever he had, the people crying &lsquo;privilege of parliament&rsquo; by
thousands and prayed God to turn the heart of the king, shutting
up their shops and standing at their doors with swords and halberds.&rdquo;<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
On the 10th, amidst general manifestations of hostility,
Charles left Whitehall to prepare for war, destined never to return
till he was brought back by his victorious enemies to die.</p>

<p>Several months followed spent in manoeuvres to obtain the
control of the forces and in a paper war of controversy. On the
23rd of April Charles was refused entry into Hull, and on the
2nd of June the parliament sent to him the &ldquo;Nineteen Propositions,&rdquo;
claiming the whole sovereignty and government for the
parliament, including the choice of the ministers, the judges, and
the control of the army, and the execution of the laws against the
Roman Catholics. The military events of the war are described
in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Great Rebellion</a></span>. On the 22nd of August the
king set up his standard at Nottingham, and on the 23rd of
October he fought the indecisive battle of Edgehill, occupying
Oxford and advancing as far as Brentford. It seemed possible
that the war might immediately be ended by Charles penetrating
to the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s position and occupying London, but
he drew back on the 13th of November before the parliamentary
force at Turnham Green, and avoided a decisive contest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page909" id="page909"></a>909</span> </p>

<p>Next year (1643) another campaign, for surrounding instead of
penetrating into London, was projected. Newcastle and Hopton
were to advance from the north and west, seize the north and
south banks of the river below the city, destroy its commerce,
and combine with Charles at Oxford. The royalist force, however,
in spite of victories at Adwalton Moor (June 30th) and Roundway
Down (July 13th), did not succeed in combining with Charles,
Newcastle in the north being kept back by the Eastern Association
and the presence of the enemy at Hull, and Hopton in the
west being detained by their successful holding out at Plymouth.
Being too weak to attempt anything alone against London,
Charles marched to besiege Gloucester, Essex following him and
relieving the place. Subsequently the rival forces fought the
indecisive first battle of Newbury, and Charles failed in preventing
the return of Essex to London. Meanwhile on the 1st of
February the parliament had submitted proposals to Charles
at Oxford, but the negotiations came to nothing, and Charles&rsquo;s
unwise attempt at the same time to stir up a rising in his favour
in the city, known as Waller&rsquo;s Plot, injured his cause considerably.
He once more turned for help to Ireland, where the cessation of
the campaign against the rebels was agreed upon on the 15th of
September 1643, and several English regiments became thereby
available for employment by the king in England. Charles also
accepted the proposal for bringing over 2000 Irish. On the 22nd
of January 1644 the king opened the rival parliament at Oxford.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1644 began far less favourably for Charles
than the two last, principally owing to the alliance now made
between the Scots and the parliament, the parliament taking the
Solemn League and Covenant on the 25th of September 1643,
and the Scottish army crossing the border on the 19th of January
1644. No attempt was this year made against London, and
Rupert was sent to Newcastle&rsquo;s succour in the north, where the
great disaster of Marston Moor on the 2nd of July ruined Charles&rsquo;s
last chances in that quarter. Meanwhile Charles himself had
defeated Waller at Cropredy Bridge on the 29th of June, and he
subsequently followed Essex to the west, compelling the surrender
of Essex&rsquo;s infantry at Lostwithiel on the 2nd of September.
With an ill-timed leniency he allowed the men to go free after
giving up their stores and arms, and on his return towards
Oxford he was confronted again by Essex&rsquo;s army at Newbury,
combined now with that of Waller and of Manchester. Charles
owed his escape here from complete annihilation only to
Manchester&rsquo;s unwillingness to inflict a total defeat, and he was
allowed to get away with his artillery to Oxford and to revictual
Donnington Castle and Basing House.</p>

<p>The negotiations carried on at Uxbridge during January and
February 1645 failed to secure a settlement, and on the 14th of
June the crushing defeat of the king&rsquo;s forces by the new model
army at Naseby practically ended the civil war. Charles, however,
refused to make peace on Rupert&rsquo;s advice, and considered
it a point of honour &ldquo;neither to abandon God&rsquo;s cause, injure my
successors, nor forsake my friends.&rdquo; His chief hope was to join
Montrose in Scotland, but his march north was prevented by the
parliamentary forces, and on the 24th of September he witnessed
from the walls of Chester the rout of his followers at Rowton
Heath. He now entered into a series of intrigues, mutually
destructive, which, becoming known to the different parties,
exasperated all and diminished still further the king&rsquo;s credit.
One proposal was the levy of a foreign force to reduce the kingdom;
another, the supply through the marquis of Ormonde of 10,000
Irish. Correspondence relating to these schemes, fatally compromising
as they were if Charles hoped ever to rule England
again, was discovered by his enemies, including the Glamorgan
treaty, which went much further than the instructions to
Ormonde, but of which the full responsibility has never been
really traced to Charles, who on the 29th of January 1646 disavowed
his agent&rsquo;s proceedings. He simultaneously treated with
the parliament, and promised toleration to the Roman Catholics
if they and the pope would aid in the restoration of the monarchy
and the church. Nor was this all. The parliamentary forces had
been closing round Oxford. On the 27th of April the king left
the city, and on the 5th of May gave himself up to the Scottish
army at Newark, arriving on the 13th with them at Newcastle.
On the 13th of July the parliament sent to Charles the
&ldquo;Newcastle Propositions,&rdquo; which included the extreme demands
of Charles&rsquo;s acceptance of the Covenants, the abolition of episcopacy
and establishment of Presbyterianism, severer laws against the
Roman Catholics and parliamentary control of the forces, with
the withdrawal of the Irish Cessation, and a long list of royalists
to be exempted from pardon. Charles returned no definite answer
for several months. He imagined that he might now find support
in Scottish royalism, encouraged by Montrose&rsquo;s series of brilliant
victories, but these hopes were destroyed by the latter&rsquo;s defeat at
Philiphaugh on the 3rd of September. The Scots insisted on the
Covenant and on the permanent establishment of Presbyterianism,
while Charles would only consent to a temporary maintenance
for three years. Accordingly the Scots, in return for the payment
of part of their army arrears by the parliament, marched home on
the 30th of January 1647, leaving Charles behind, who under the
care of the parliamentary commissioners was conducted to
Holmby House. Thence on the 12th of May he sent his answer
to the Newcastle Propositions, offering the militia to the parliament
for ten years and the establishment of Presbyterianism for
three, while a final settlement on religion was to be reached
through an assembly of twenty divines at Westminster. But in
the midst of the negotiation with the parliament Charles&rsquo;s person
was seized, on the 3rd of June 1647, by Cornet Joyce under instructions
of the army, which soon afterwards occupied London and
overpowered the parliament, placing Charles at Hampton Court.</p>

<p>If Charles could have remained firm to either one or the other
faction, and have made concessions either to Presbyterianism
or on the subject of the militia, he might even now have prevailed.
But he had learned nothing by experience, and continued
at this juncture his characteristic policy of intrigue and double-dealing,
&ldquo;playing his game,&rdquo; to use his own words, negotiating
with both parties at once, not with the object or wish to arrive
at a settlement with either, but to augment their disputes, gain
time and profit ultimately by their divisions. The &ldquo;Heads of the
Proposals,&rdquo; submitted to Charles by the army on the 28th of
July 1647, were terms conceived on a basis far broader and more
statesmanlike than the Newcastle Propositions, and such as
Charles might well have accepted. The proposals on religion
anticipated the Toleration Act of 1689. There was no mention
of episcopacy, and its existence was thereby indirectly admitted,
but complete religious freedom for all Protestant denominations
was provided, and the power of the church to inflict civil penalties
abolished, while it was also suggested that dangers from Roman
Catholics and Jesuits might be avoided by means other than
enforcing attendance at church. The parliament was to dissolve
itself and be succeeded by biennial assemblies elected on a reformed
franchise, not to be dissolved without their own consent
before 120 days, and not to sit more than 240 days in the two
years. A council of state was to conduct the foreign policy
of the state and conclude peace and war subject to the approval
of parliament, and to control the militia for ten years, the commanders
being appointed by parliament, as also the officers of
state for ten years. No peer created since May the 21st, 1642,
was to sit in parliament without consent of both Houses, and
the judicial decisions of the House of Lords were to be ratified
by the Commons. Only five persons were excepted from amnesty,
but royalists were not to hold office for five years and
not to sit in the Commons till the end of the second biennial
parliament. Proposals for a series of reforms were also added.
Charles, however, was at the same time negotiating with Lauderdale
for an invasion of England by the Scots, and imagined he
could win over Cromwell and Fairfax by &ldquo;proffers of advantage
to themselves.&rdquo; The precious opportunity was therefore allowed
to slip by. On the 9th of September he rejected the proposals
of the parliament for the establishment of Presbyterianism.
His hopes of gaining advantages by playing upon the differences
of his opponents proved a complete failure. Fresh terms were
drawn up by the army and parliament together on the 10th of
November, but before these could be presented, Charles, on the
11th, had escaped to Carisbrooke Castle in the Isle of Wight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page910" id="page910"></a>910</span>
Thence on the 16th he sent a message offering Presbyterianism
for three years and the militia for his lifetime to the parliament,
but insisting on the maintenance of episcopacy. On the 28th
of December he refused his assent to the Four Bills, which demanded
the militia for parliament for twenty years and practically
for ever, annulled the honours recently granted by the
king and his declarations against the Houses, and gave to parliament
the right to adjourn to any place it wished. On the 3rd
of January 1648 the Commons agreed to a resolution to address
the king no further, in which they were joined by the Lords on
the 15th.</p>

<p>Charles had meanwhile taken a further fatal step which
brought about his total destruction. On the 26th of December
1647 he had signed at Carisbrooke with the Scottish commissioners
the secret treaty called the &ldquo;Engagement,&rdquo; whereby
the Scots undertook to invade England on his behalf and restore
him to the throne on condition of the establishment of Presbyterianism
for three years and the suppression of the sectarians.
In consequence the second civil war broke out and the Scots
invaded England under Hamilton. The royalist risings in
England were soon suppressed, and Cromwell gained an easy
and decisive victory over the Scots at Preston. Charles was
now left alone to face his enemies, with the whole tale of his
intrigues and deceptions unmasked and exposed. The last
intrigue with the Scots was the most unpardonable in the eyes
of his contemporaries, no less wicked and monstrous than his
design to conquer England by the Irish soldiers; &ldquo;a more
prodigious treason,&rdquo; said Cromwell, &ldquo;than any that had been
perfected before; because the former quarrel was that Englishmen
might rule over one another; this to vassalize us to a
foreign nation.&rdquo; Cromwell, who up to this point had shown
himself foremost in supporting the negotiations with the king,
now spoke of the treaty of Newport, which he found the parliament
in the act of negotiating on his return from Scotland, as
&ldquo;this ruining hypocritical agreement.&rdquo; Charles had engaged
in these negotiations only to gain time and find opportunity to
escape. &ldquo;The great concession I made this day,&rdquo; he wrote on
the 7th of October, &ldquo;was made merely in order to my escape.&rdquo;
At the beginning he had stipulated that no concession from him
should be valid unless an agreement were reached upon every
point. He had now consented to most of the demands of the
parliament, including the repudiation of the Irish Cessation, the
surrender of the delinquents and the cession of the militia for
twenty years, and of the offices of state to parliament, but
remained firm in his refusal to abolish episcopacy, consenting
only to Presbyterianism for three years. Charles&rsquo;s devotion to
the church is undoubted. In April 1646, before his flight from
Oxford, inspired perhaps by superstitious fears as to the origin
of his misfortunes, he had delivered to Sheldon, afterwards
archbishop of Canterbury, a written vow (now in the library of
St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral) to restore all church lands held by the
crown on his restoration to the throne; and almost his last
injunction to the prince of Wales was that of fidelity to the
national church. His present firmness, however, in its support
was caused probably less by his devotion to it than by his desire
to secure the failure of the whole treaty, and his attempts to
escape naturally weakened the chances of success. Cromwell
now supported the petitions of the army against the treaty. On
the 16th of November the council of officers demanded the trial
of the king, &ldquo;the capital and grand author of our troubles,&rdquo;
and on the 27th of November the parliamentary commissioners
returned from Newport without having secured Charles&rsquo;s
consent. Charles was removed to Hurst Castle on the 1st of
December, where he remained till the 19th, thence being taken
to Windsor, where he arrived on the 23rd. On the 6th &ldquo;Pride&rsquo;s
Purge&rdquo; had removed from the Commons all those who might
show any favour to the king. On the 25th a last attempt by the
council of officers to come to terms with him was repulsed. On
the 1st of January the remnant of the Commons resolved that
Charles was guilty of treason by &ldquo;levying war against the
parliament and kingdom of England&rdquo;; on the 4th they declared
their own power to make laws without the lords or the sovereign,
and on the 6th established a &ldquo;high court of justice&rdquo; to try the
king. On the 19th Charles was brought to St James&rsquo;s Palace,
and on the next day his trial began in Westminster Hall, without
the assistance of any of the judges, who all refused to take part
in the proceedings. He laughed aloud at hearing himself called
a traitor, and immediately demanded by what authority he was
tried. He had been in treaty with the parliament in the Isle of
Wight and taken thence by force; he saw no lords present.
He was told by Bradshaw, the president of the court, that he
was tried by the authority of the people of England, who had
elected him king; Charles making the obvious reply that he was
king by inheritance and not by election, that England had been
for more than 1000 years an hereditary kingdom, and Bradshaw
cutting short the discussion by adjourning the court. On the
22nd Charles repeated his reasoning, adding, &ldquo;It is not my case
alone; it is the freedom and liberty of the people of England,
and do you pretend what you will, I stand more for their liberties,
for if power without law may make laws ... I do not know
what subject he is in England that can be sure of his life or
anything that he calls his own.&rdquo; On the 23rd he again refused to
plead. The court was adjourned, and there were several signs
that the army in their prosecution of the king had not the nation
at their back. While the soldiers had shouted &ldquo;Justice!
justice!&rdquo; as the king passed through their ranks, the civilian
spectators from the end of the hall had cried &ldquo;God save the
king!&rdquo; There was considerable opposition and reluctance to
proceed among the members of the court. On the 26th, however,
the court decided unanimously upon his execution, and on the
27th Charles was brought into court for the last time to hear
his sentence. His request to be heard before the Lords and
Commons was rejected, and his attempts to answer the charges
of the president were silenced. Sentence was pronounced, and
the king was removed by the soldiers, uttering his last broken
protest: &ldquo;I am not suffered to speak. Expect what justice
other people will have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these last hours Charles, who was probably weary of life,
showed a remarkable dignity and self-possession, and a firm
resignation supported by religious faith and by the absolute
conviction of his own innocence, which, says Burnet, &ldquo;amazed
all people and that so much the more because it was not natural
to him. It was imputed to a very extraordinary measure of
supernatural assistance....; it was owing to something
within himself that he went through so many indignities with
so much true greatness without disorder or any sort of affectation.&rdquo;
Nothing in his life became Charles like the leaving it.
&ldquo;He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene.&rdquo;
On the morning of the 29th of January he said his last sad
farewell to his younger children, Elizabeth and Henry, duke
of Gloucester. On the 30th at ten o&rsquo;clock he walked across
from St James&rsquo;s to Whitehall, calling on his guard &ldquo;in a
pleasant manner&rdquo; to walk apace, and at two he stepped upon
the scaffold from a window, probably the middle one, of the
Banqueting House (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>, Plate VI., fig. 75). He
was separated from the people by large ranks of soldiers,
and his last speech only reached Juxon and those with him
on the scaffold. He declared that he had desired the liberty
and freedom of the people as much as any; &ldquo;but I must tell
you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government.
 ... It is not their having a share in the government;
that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a
sovereign are clean different things.&rdquo; These, together with his
declaration that he died a member of the Church of England,
and the mysterious &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; spoken to Juxon, were
Charles&rsquo;s last words. &ldquo;It much discontents the citizens,&rdquo;
wrote a spectator; &ldquo;ye manner of his deportment was very
resolutely with some smiling countenances, intimating his
willingness to be out of his troubles.&rdquo;<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> &ldquo;The blow I saw given,&rdquo;
wrote another, Philip Henry, &ldquo;and can truly say with a sad
heart, at the instant whereof, I remember well, there was such
a grone by the Thousands then present as I never heard before
and desire I may never hear again. There was according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page911" id="page911"></a>911</span>
order one Troop immediately marching fromwards Charing-Cross
to Westminster and another fromwards Westminster to Charing-Cross,
purposely to masker&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> to overpower) &ldquo;the people
and to disperse and scatter them, so that I had much adoe
amongst the rest to escape home without hurt.&rdquo;<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>Amidst such scenes of violence was at last effected the destruction
of Charles. &ldquo;It is lawful,&rdquo; wrote Milton, &ldquo;and hath been
held so through all ages for any one who have the power to call
to account a Tyrant or wicked King and after due conviction to
depose and put him to death.&rdquo;<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a> But here (it might well be
contended) there had been no &ldquo;due conviction.&rdquo; The execution
had been the act of the king&rsquo;s personal enemies, of &ldquo;only some
fifty or sixty governing Englishmen with Oliver Cromwell in the
midst of them&rdquo; an act technically illegal, morally unjustifiable
because the supposed crimes of Charles had been condoned by
the later negotiations with him, and indefensible on the ground of
public expediency, for the king&rsquo;s death proved a far greater
obstacle to the re-establishment of settled government than his
life could have been. The result was an extraordinary revulsion
of feeling in favour of Charles and the monarchy, in which the
incidents of his misgovernment were completely forgotten. He
soon became in the popular veneration a martyr and a saint.
His fate was compared with the Crucifixion, and his trials and
sufferings to those of the Saviour. Handkerchiefs dipped in his
blood wrought &ldquo;miracles,&rdquo; and the <i>Eikon Basilike</i>, published
on the day of his funeral, presented to the public a touching
if not a genuine portrait of the unfortunate sovereign. At the
Restoration the anniversary of his death was ordered to be kept
as a day of fasting and humiliation, and the service appointed
for use on the occasion was only removed from the prayer-book
in 1859. The same conception of Charles as a martyr for religion
appeals still to many, and has been stimulated by modern
writers. &ldquo;Had Charles been willing to abandon the church and
give up episcopacy,&rdquo; says Bishop Creighton, &ldquo;he might have
saved his throne and his life. But on this point Charles stood
firm, for this he died and by dying saved it for the future.&rdquo;<a name="fa6d" id="fa6d" href="#ft6d"><span class="sp">6</span></a>
Gladstone, Keble, Newman write in the same strain. &ldquo;It was
for the Church,&rdquo; says Gladstone, &ldquo;that Charles shed his blood
upon the scaffold.&rdquo;<a name="fa7d" id="fa7d" href="#ft7d"><span class="sp">7</span></a> &ldquo;I rest,&rdquo; says Newman, &ldquo;on the scenes
of past years, from the Upper Room in Acts to the Court of
Carisbrooke and Uxbridge.&rdquo; The injustice and violence of the
king&rsquo;s death, however, the pathetic dignity of his last days, and
the many noble traits in his character, cannot blind us to the
real causes of his downfall and destruction, and a sober judgment
cannot allow that Charles was really a martyr either for the
church or for the popular liberties.</p>

<p>The constitutional struggle between the crown and parliament
had not been initiated by Charles I. It was in full existence in
the reign of James I., and distinct traces appear towards the
latter part of that of Elizabeth. Charles, therefore, in some
degree inherited a situation for which he was not responsible,
nor can he be justly blamed, according to the ideas of kingship
which then prevailed, for defending the prerogatives of the
crown as precious and sacred personal possessions which it was
his duty to hand down intact to his successors. Neither will
his persistence in refusing to yield up the control of the executive
to the parliament or the army, or his zeal in defending the
national church, be altogether censured. In the event the parliament
proved quite incapable of governing, an army uncontrolled
by the sovereign was shown to constitute a more grievous
tyranny than Charles&rsquo;s most arbitrary rule, and the downfall
of the church seen to make room only for a sectarian despotism
as intolerable as the Laudian. The natural inference might be
that both conceptions of government had much to support
them, that they were bound sooner or later to come into collision,
and that the actual individuals in the drama, including the king
himself, were rather the victims of the greatness of events than
real actors in the scene, still less the controllers of their own
and the national destiny. A closer insight, however, shows that
biographical more than abstract historical elements determined
the actual course and issue of the Rebellion. The great constitutional
and religious points of dispute between the king and
parliament, though doubtless involving principles vital to the
national interests, would not alone have sufficed to destroy
Charles. Monarchy was too much venerated, was too deeply
rooted in the national life, to be hastily and easily extirpated;
the perils of removing the foundation of all government, law
and order were too obvious not to be shunned at almost all costs.
Still less can the crowning tragedy of the king&rsquo;s death find its
real explanation or justification in these disputes and antagonisms.
The real cause was the complete discredit into which
Charles had brought himself and the monarchy. The ordinary
routine of daily life and of business cannot continue without
some degree of mutual confidence between the individuals
brought into contact, far less could relations be maintained by
subjects with a king endowed with the enormous powers then
attached to the kingship, and with whom agreements, promises,
negotiations were merely subterfuges and prevarications. We
have seen the series of unhappy falsehoods and deceptions
which constituted Charles&rsquo;s statecraft, beginning with the
fraud concerning the concessions to the Roman Catholics at his
marriage, the evasions with which he met the Petition of Right,
the abandonment of Strafford, the simultaneous negotiation
with, and betrayal of, all parties. Strafford&rsquo;s reported words
on hearing of his desertion by Charles, &ldquo;Put not your trust in
princes,&rdquo; re-echo through the whole of Charles&rsquo;s reign. It was
the degradation and dishonour of the kingship, and the personal
loss of credit which Charles suffered through these transactions&mdash;which
never appear to have caused him a moment&rsquo;s regret or
uneasiness, but the fatal consequences of which were seen only
too clearly by men like Hyde and Falkland&mdash;that were the real
causes of the rebellion and of the king&rsquo;s execution. The constitutional
and religious grievances were the outward and
visible sign of the corroding suspicions which slowly consumed
the national loyalty. In themselves there was nothing incapable
of settlement either through the spirit of union which existed
between Elizabeth and her subjects, or by the principle of
compromise which formed the basis of the constitutional settlement
in 1688. The bond of union between his people and
himself Charles had, however, early broken, and compromise
is only possible between parties both of whom can acknowledge
to some extent the force of the other&rsquo;s position, which can trust
one another, and which are sincere in their endeavour to reach
agreement. Thus on Charles himself chiefly falls the responsibility
for the catastrophe.</p>

<p>His character and motives fill a large place in English history,
but they have never been fully understood and possibly were
largely due to physical causes. His weakness as a child was so
extreme that his life was despaired of. He outgrew physical
defects, and as a young man excelled in horsemanship and in
the sports of the times, but always retained an impediment of
speech. At the time of his accession his reserve and reticence
were especially noticed. Buckingham was the only person who
ever enjoyed his friendship, and after his death Charles placed
entire confidence in no man. This isolation was the cause of an
ignorance of men and of the world, and of an incapacity to
appreciate the ideas, principles and motives of others, while it
prepared at the same time a fertile soil for receiving those
exalted conceptions of kingship, of divine right and prerogative,
which came into vogue at this period, together with those
exaggerated ideas of his own personal supremacy and importance
to which minds not quite normal are always especially inclined.
His character was marked by a weakness which shirked and
postponed the settlement of difficulties, by a meanness and
ingratitude even when dealing with his most devoted followers,
by an obstinacy which only feigned compliance and by an untruthfulness
which differed widely from his son&rsquo;s unblushing deceit,
which found always some reservation or excuse, but which while
more scrupulous was also more dangerous and insidious because
employed continually as a principle of conduct. Yet Charles, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page912" id="page912"></a>912</span>
spite of his failings, had many fine qualities. Clarendon, who was
fully conscious of them, who does not venture to call him a good
king, and allows that &ldquo;his kingly virtues had some mixture and
alloy that hindered them from shining in full lustre,&rdquo; declares
that &ldquo;he was if ever any, the most worthy of the title of an
Honest Man, so great a lover of justice that no temptation could
dispose him to a wrongful action except that it was disguised to
him that he believed it just,&rdquo; &ldquo;the worthiest of gentlemen, the
best master, the best friend, the best husband, the best father
and the best Christian that the age in which he lived produced.&rdquo;
With all its deplorable mistakes and failings Charles I.&rsquo;s reign
belongs to a sphere infinitely superior to that of his unscrupulous,
corrupt, selfish but more successful son. His private life was without
a blemish. Immediately on his accession he had suppressed
the disorder which had existed in the household of James I.,
and let it be known that whoever had business with him
&ldquo;must never approach him by backstairs or private doors.&rdquo;<a name="fa8d" id="fa8d" href="#ft8d"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
He maintained a strict sobriety in food and dress. He had a
fine artistic sense, and Milton reprehends him for having made
Shakespeare &ldquo;the closest companion of his solitudes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monsieur
le Prince de Galles,&rdquo; wrote Rubens in 1625, &ldquo;est le prince
le plus amateur de la peinture qui soit au monde.&rdquo; He succeeded
in bringing together during twenty years an unrivalled collection,
of which a great part was dispersed at his death. He showed
a noble insensibility to flattery. He was deeply and sincerely
religious. He wished to do right, and was conscious of the purity
of his motives. Those who came into contact with him, even
the most bitter of his opponents, were impressed with his goodness.
The great tragedy of his life, to be read in his well-known,
dignified, but weak and unhappy features, and to be followed
in his inexplicable and mysterious choice of baneful instruments,
such as Rupert, Laud, Hamilton, Glamorgan, Henrietta Maria&mdash;all
in their several ways working out his destruction&mdash;seems
to have been inspired by a fateful insanity or infirmity of mind or
will, recalling the great Greek dramas in which the poets depicted
frenzied mortals rushing into their own destruction, impelled
by the unseen and superior powers.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s body, after being embalmed, was buried by the
few followers who remained with him to the last, hastily and
without any funeral service, which was forbidden by the authorities,
in the tomb of Henry VIII., in St George&rsquo;s Chapel, Windsor,
where his coffin was identified and opened in 1813. An &ldquo;account
of what appeared&rdquo; was published by Sir Henry Halford, and
a bone abstracted on the occasion was replaced in the vault by
the prince of Wales (afterwards Edward VII.) in 1888. Charles I.
left, besides three children who died in infancy, Charles (afterwards
Charles II.); James (afterwards James II.); Henry, duke
of Gloucester (1639-1660); Mary (1631-1660), who married
William of Orange; Elizabeth (1635-1650); and Henrietta,
duchess of Orleans (1644-1670).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1630-1685), king of Great Britain and Ireland,
second son of Charles I. and Queen Henrietta Maria, was born
on the 29th of May 1630 at St James&rsquo;s Palace, and was brought
up under the care successively of the countess of Dorset, William
Cavendish, duke of Newcastle, and the marquess of Hertford.
He accompanied the king during the campaigns of the Civil War,
and sat in the parliament at Oxford, but on the 4th of March 1645
he was sent by Charles I. to the west, accompanied by Hyde and
others who formed his council. Owing, however, to the mutual
jealousies and misconduct of Goring and Grenville, and the
prince&rsquo;s own disregard and contempt of the council, his presence
was in no way advantageous, and could not prevent the final
overthrow of the king&rsquo;s forces in 1646. He retired (17th of
February) to Pendennis Castle at Falmouth, and on the approach
of Fairfax (2nd of March) to Scilly, where he remained with
Hyde till the 16th of April. Thence he fled to Jersey, and
finally refusing all the overtures from the parliament, and in
opposition to the counsels of Hyde, who desired the prince to
remain on English territory, he repaired to the queen at Paris,
where he remained for two years. He is described at this time
by Mme de Motteville as &ldquo;well-made, with a swarthy complexion
agreeing well with his fine black eyes, a large ugly mouth, a
graceful and dignified carriage and a fine figure&rdquo;; and according
to the description circulated later for his capture after the battle
of Worcester, he was over six feet tall. He received instruction
in mathematics from Hobbes, and was early initiated into all
the vices of the age by Buckingham and Percy. In July 1648
the prince joined the royalist fleet and blockaded the Thames
with a fleet of eleven ships, returning to Holland, where he
received the news of the final royalist defeats and afterwards of
the execution of his father. On the 14th of January 1649 he
had forwarded to the council a signed <i>carte blanche</i>, granting any
conditions provided his father&rsquo;s life were spared. He immediately
assumed the title of king, and was proclaimed in Scotland
(5th of February) and in some parts of Ireland. On the 17th of
September, after a visit to his mother at St Germain, Charles
went to Jersey and issued a declaration proclaiming his rights;
but, owing to the arrival of the fleet at Portsmouth, he was
obliged, on the 13th of February 1650, to return again to Breda.
The projected invasion of Ireland was delayed through want of
funds till it was too late; Hyde&rsquo;s mission to Spain, in the midst
of Cromwell&rsquo;s&rsquo; successes, brought no assistance, and Charles now
turned to Scotland for aid. Employing the same unscrupulous
and treacherous methods which had proved so fatal to his father,
he simultaneously supported and encouraged the expedition of
Montrose and the royalists, and negotiated with the covenanters.
On the 1st of May he signed the first draft of a treaty at Breda
with the latter, in which he accepted the Solemn League and
Covenant, conceded the control of public and church affairs to
the parliament and the kirk, and undertook to establish Presbyterianism
in the three kingdoms. He also signed privately a
paper repudiating Ormonde and the loyal Irish, and recalling
the commissions granted to them. In acting thus he did not
scruple to desert his own royalist followers, and to repudiate
and abandon the great and noble Montrose, whose heroic efforts
he was apparently merely using in order to extort better terms
from the covenanters, and who, having been captured on the 4th
of May, was executed on the 21st in spite of some attempts by
Charles to procure for him an indemnity.</p>

<p>Thus perjured and disgraced the young king embarked for
Scotland on the 2nd of June; on the 11th when off Heligoland
he signed the treaty, and on the 23rd, on his arrival at Speymouth,
before landing, he swore to both the covenants. He proceeded
to Falkland near Perth and passed through Aberdeen, where
he saw the mutilated arm of Montrose suspended over the
city gate. He was compelled to dismiss all his followers except
Buckingham, and to submit to interminable sermons, which
generally contained violent invectives against his parents and
himself. To Argyll he promised the payment of £40,000 at his
restoration, doubtless the sum owing as arrears of the Scottish
army unpaid when Charles I. was surrendered to the English
at Newcastle, and entered into negotiations for marrying his
daughter. In August he was forced to sign a further declaration,
confessing his own wickedness in dealing with the Irish, his father&rsquo;s
blood-guiltiness, his mother&rsquo;s idolatry, and his abhorrence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page913" id="page913"></a>913</span>
of prelacy, besides ratifying his allegiance to the covenants
and to Presbyterianism. At the same time he declared himself
secretly to King, dean of Tuam, &ldquo;a true child of the Church of
England,&rdquo; &ldquo;a true Cavalier,&rdquo; and avowed that &ldquo;what concerns
Ireland is in no ways binding&rdquo;; while to the Roman Catholics
in England he promised concessions and expressed his goodwill
towards their church to Pope Innocent X. His attempt, called
&ldquo;The Start,&rdquo; on the 4th of October 1650, to escape from the
faction at Perth and to join Huntly and the royalists in the
north failed, and he was overtaken and compelled to return.
On the 1st of January 1651 he was crowned at Scone, when he
was forced to repeat his oaths to both the covenants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cromwell had advanced and had defeated the
Presbyterians at Dunbar on the 3rd of September 1650, subsequently
occupying Edinburgh. This defeat was not wholly
unwelcome to Charles in the circumstances; in the following
summer, during Cromwell&rsquo;s advance to the north, he shook off
the Presbyterian influence, and on the 31st of July 1651 marched
south into England with an army of about 10,000 commanded
by David Leslie. He was proclaimed king at Carlisle, joined
by the earl of Derby in Lancashire, evaded the troops of Lambert
and Harrison in Cheshire, marched through Shropshire, meeting
with a rebuff at Shrewsbury, and entered Worcester with a
small, tired and dispirited force of only 16,000 men (22nd of
August). Here the decisive battle, which ruined his hopes, and
in which Charles distinguished himself by conspicuous courage
and fortitude, was fought on the 3rd of September. After leading
an unsuccessful cavalry charge against the enemy he fled, about
6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, accompanied by Buckingham, Derby, Wilmot, Lauderdale
and others, towards Kidderminster, taking refuge at Whiteladies,
about 25 m. from Worcester, where he separated himself
from all his followers except Wilmot, concealing himself in the
famous oak during the 6th of September, moving subsequently
to Boscobel, to Moseley and Bentley Hall, and thence, disguised
as Miss Lane&rsquo;s attendant, to Abbots Leigh near Bristol, to Trent
in Somersetshire, and finally to the George Inn at Brighton,
having been recognized during the forty-one days of his wanderings
by about fifty persons, none of whom, in spite of the reward
of £1000 offered for his capture, or of the death penalty threatened
for aiding his concealment, had betrayed him.</p>

<p>He set sail from Shoreham on the 15th of October 1651, and
landed at Fécamp in Normandy the next day. He resided
at Paris at St Germain till June 1654, in inactivity, unable to
make any further effort, and living with difficulty on a grant
from Louis XIV. of 600 livres a month. Various missions to
foreign powers met with failure; he was excluded from Holland
by the treaty made with England in April 1654, and he anticipated
his expulsion from France, owing to the new relations of
friendship established with Cromwell, by quitting the country
in July. He visited his sister, the princess of Orange, at Spa, and
went to Aix-la-Chapelle, thence finally proceeding in November
to Cologne, where he was hospitably received. The conclusion
of Cromwell&rsquo;s treaty with France in October 1655, and the
war between England and Spain, gave hope of aid from the
latter power. In April 1656 Charles went to Bruges, and on the
7th of February 1658 to Brussels, where he signed a treaty with
Don John of Austria, governor of the Spanish Netherlands, by
which he received an allowance in place of his French pension
and undertook to assemble all his subjects in France in aid of
the Spanish against the French. This plan, however, came to
nothing; projected risings in England were betrayed, and by
the capture of Dunkirk in June 1658, after the battle of the
Dunes, by the French and Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides, the Spanish
cause in Flanders was ruined.</p>

<p>As long as Cromwell lived there appeared little hope of the
restoration of the monarchy, and Charles and Hyde had been
aware of the plots for his assassination, which had aroused no
disapproval. By the protector&rsquo;s death on the 3rd of September
1658 the scene was wholly changed, and amidst the consequent
confusion of factions the cry for the restoration of the monarchy
grew daily in strength. The premature royalist rising, however,
in August 1659 was defeated, and Charles, who had awaited
the result on the coast of Brittany, proceeded to Fuenterrabia
on the Spanish frontier, where Mazarin and Luis de Haro were
negotiating the treaty of the Pyrenees, to induce both powers to
support his cause; but the failure of the attempt in England
ensured the rejection of his request, and he returned to
Brussels in December, visiting his mother at Paris on the way.
Events had meanwhile developed fast in favour of a restoration.
Charles, by Hyde&rsquo;s advice, had not interfered in the movement,
and had avoided inconvenient concessions to the various factions
by referring all to a &ldquo;free parliament.&rdquo; He left Brussels for
Breda, and issued in April 1660, together with the letters to the
council, the officers of the army and the houses of parliament
and the city, the declaration of an amnesty for all except those
specially excluded afterwards by parliament, which referred to
parliament the settlement of estates and promised a liberty to
tender consciences in matters of religion not contrary to the
peace of the kingdom.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May Charles II. was proclaimed king in Westminster
Hall and elsewhere in London. On the 24th he sailed
from the Hague, landing on the 26th at Dover, where he was met
by Monk, whom he saluted as father, and by the mayor, from
whom he accepted a &ldquo;very rich bible,&rdquo; &ldquo;the thing that he
loved above all things in the world.&rdquo; He reached London on
the 29th, his thirtieth birthday, arriving with the procession,
amidst general rejoicings and &ldquo;through a lane of happy faces,&rdquo;
at seven in the evening at Whitehall, where the houses of
parliament awaited his coming, to offer in the name of the
nation their congratulations and allegiance.</p>

<p>No event in the history of England had been attended with
more lively and general rejoicing than Charles&rsquo;s restoration, and
none was destined to cause greater subsequent disappointment
and disillusion. Indolent, sensual and dissipated by nature,
Charles&rsquo;s vices had greatly increased during his exile abroad,
and were now, with the great turn of fortune which gave him
full opportunity to indulge them, to surpass all the bounds of
decency and control. A long residence till the age of thirty
abroad, together with his French blood, had made him politically
more of a foreigner than an Englishman, and he returned to
England ignorant of the English constitution, a Roman Catholic
and a secret adversary of the national religion, and untouched
by the sentiment of England&rsquo;s greatness or of patriotism. Pure
selfishness was the basis of his policy both in domestic and
foreign affairs. Abroad the great national interests were eagerly
sacrificed for the sake of a pension, and at home his personal
ease and pleasure alone decided every measure, and the fate of
every minister and subject. During his exile he had surrounded
himself with young men of the same spirit as himself, such as
Buckingham and Bennet, who, without having any claim to
statesmanship, inattentive to business, neglectful of the national
interests and national prejudices, became Charles&rsquo;s chief advisers.
With them, as with their master, public office was only desirable
as a means of procuring enjoyment, for which an absolute
monarchy provided the most favourable conditions. Such
persons were now, accordingly, destined to supplant the older
and responsible ministers of the type of Clarendon and Ormonde,
men of high character and patriotism, who followed definite lines
of policy, while at the same time the younger men of ability and
standing were shut out from office.</p>

<p>The first period of Charles II.&rsquo;s reign (1660-1667) was that of
the administration of Lord Clarendon, the principal author of the
Restoration settlement. The king was granted the large revenue
of £1,300,000. The naval and military forces were disbanded,
but Charles managed to retain under the name of guards three
regiments, which remained the nucleus of a standing army. The
settlement of estates on a legal basis provided ill for a large
number of the king&rsquo;s adherents who had impoverished themselves
in his cause. The king&rsquo;s honour was directly involved in their
compensation and, except for the gratification of a few individuals,
was tarnished by his neglect to afford them relief. Charles used
his influence to carry through parliament the act of indemnity,
and the execution of some of the regicides was a measure not more
severe than was to be expected in the times and circumstances;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page914" id="page914"></a>914</span>
but that of Sir Henry Vane, who was not a regicide and whose life
Charles had promised the parliament to spare in case of his condemnation,
was brought about by Charles&rsquo;s personal insistence
in revenge for the victim&rsquo;s high bearing during his trial, and was
an act of gross cruelty and perfidy. Charles was in favour of
religious toleration, and a declaration issued by him in October
1660 aroused great hopes; but he made little effort to conciliate
the Presbyterians or to effect a settlement through the Savoy
conference, and his real object was to gain power over all the
factions and to free his co-religionists, the Roman Catholics, in
favour of whom he issued his first declaration of indulgence (26th
of December 1662), the bill to give effect to it being opposed by
Clarendon and defeated in the Lords, and being replied to by the
passing of further acts against religious liberty. Meanwhile the
plot of Venner and of the Fifth Monarchy men had been suppressed
in January 1661, and the king was crowned on the 23rd of April.
The convention parliament had been dissolved on the 29th of
December 1660, and Charles&rsquo;s first parliament, the Long Parliament
of the Restoration, which met on the 8th of May 1661 and
continued till January 1679, declared the command of the forces
inherent in the crown, repudiated the taking up of arms against
the king, and repealed in 1664 the Triennial Act, adding only a
provision that there should not be intermission of parliaments for
more than three years. In Ireland the church was re-established,
and a new settlement of land introduced by the Act of Settlement
1661 and the Act of Explanation 1665. The island was
excluded from the benefit of the Navigation Laws, and in 1666 the
importation of cattle and horses into England was forbidden. In
Scotland episcopacy was set up, the covenant to which Charles
had taken so many solemn oaths burnt by the common hangman,
and Argyll brought to the scaffold, while the kingdom was given
over to the savage and corrupt administration of Lauderdale.
On the 21st of May 1662, in pursuance of the pro-French and anti-Spanish
policy, Charles married Catherine of Braganza, daughter
of John IV. of Portugal, by which alliance England obtained
Tangier and Bombay. She brought him no children, and her
attractions for Charles were inferior to those of his mistress, Lady
Castlemaine, whom she was compelled to receive as a lady of her
bedchamber. In February 1665 the ill-omened war with Holland
was declared, during the progress of which it became apparent
how greatly the condition of the national services and the state
of administration had deteriorated since the Commonwealth,
and to what extent England was isolated and abandoned abroad,
Michael de Ruyter, on the 13th of June 1667, carrying out his
celebrated attack on Chatham and burning several warships.
The disgrace was unprecedented. Charles did not show himself
and it was reported that he had abdicated, but to allay the popular
panic it was given out &ldquo;that he was very cheerful that night at
supper with his mistresses.&rdquo; The treaty of Breda with Holland
(21st of July 1667) removed the danger, but not the ignominy,
and Charles showed the real baseness of his character when he
joined in the popular outcry against Clarendon, the upright and
devoted adherent of his father and himself during twenty-five
years of misfortune, and drove him into poverty and exile in his
old age, recalling ominously Charles I.&rsquo;s betrayal of Strafford.</p>

<p>To Clarendon now succeeded the ministry of Buckingham
and Arlington, who with Lauderdale, Ashley (afterwards Lord
Shaftesbury) and Clifford, constituted the so-called Cabal ministry
in 1672. With these advisers Charles entered into those schemes
so antagonistic to the national interests which have disgraced
his reign. His plan was to render himself independent of parliament
and of the nation by binding himself to France and the
French policy of aggrandizement, and receiving a French pension
with the secret intention as well of introducing the Roman
Catholic religion again into England. In 1661 under Clarendon&rsquo;s
rule, the evil precedent had been admitted of receiving money
from France, in 1662 Dunkirk had been sold to Louis, and in
February 1667 during the Dutch war a secret alliance had been
made with Louis, Charles promising him a free hand in the
Netherlands and Louis undertaking to support Charles&rsquo;s designs
&ldquo;in or out of the kingdom.&rdquo; In January 1668 Sir W. Temple
had made with Sweden and Holland the Triple Alliance against
the encroachments and aggrandizement of France, but this
national policy was soon upset by the king&rsquo;s own secret plans.
In 1668 the conversion of his brother James to Romanism became
known to Charles. Already in 1662 the king had sent Sir Richard
Bellings to Rome to arrange the terms of England&rsquo;s conversion,
and now in 1668 he was in correspondence with Oliva, the general
of the Jesuits in Rome, through James de la Cloche, the eldest
of his natural sons, of whom he had become the father when
scarcely sixteen during his residence at Jersey. On the 25th of
January 1669, at a secret meeting between the two royal brothers,
with Arlington, Clifford and Arundell of Wardour, it was determined
to announce to Louis XIV. the projected conversion of
Charles and the realm, and subsequent negotiations terminated
in the two secret treaties of Dover. The first, signed only, among
the ministers, by Arlington and Clifford, the rest not being
initiated, on the 20th of May 1670, provided for the return of
England to Rome and the joint attack of France and
England upon Holland, England&rsquo;s ally, together with Charles&rsquo;s
support of the Bourbon claims to the throne of Spain, while
Charles received a pension of £200,000 a year. In the second,
signed by Arlington, Buckingham, Lauderdale and Ashley on the
31st of December 1670, nothing was said about the conversion, and
the pension provided for that purpose was added to the military
subsidy, neither of these treaties being communicated to parliament
or to the nation. An immediate gain to Charles was the
acquisition of another mistress in the person of Louise de
Kéroualle, the so-called &ldquo;Madam Carwell,&rdquo; who had accompanied
the duchess of Orleans, the king&rsquo;s sister, to Dover, at the time of
the negotiations, and who joined Charles&rsquo;s seraglio, being created
duchess of Portsmouth, and acting as the agent of the French
alliance throughout the reign.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October 1670, at the very time that these
treaties were in progress, Charles opened parliament and obtained
a vote of £800,000 on the plea of supporting the Triple Alliance.
Parliament was prorogued in April 1671, not assembling again
till February 1673, and on the 2nd of January 1672 was announced
the &ldquo;stop of the exchequer,&rdquo; or national bankruptcy, one of
the most blameworthy and unscrupulous acts of the reign, by
which the payments from the exchequer ceased, and large
numbers of persons who had lent to the government were thus
ruined. On the reassembling of parliament on the 4th of
February 1673 a strong opposition was shown to the Cabal
ministry which had been constituted at the end of 1672. The
Dutch War, declared on the 17th of March 1672, though the commercial
and naval jealousies of Holland had certainly not disappeared
in England, was unpopular because of the alliance with
France and the attack upon Protestantism, while the king&rsquo;s
second declaration of indulgence (15th of March 1672) aroused
still further antagonism, was declared illegal by the parliament,
and was followed up by the Test Act, which obliged James and
Clifford to resign their offices. In February 1674 the war with
Holland was closed by the treaty of London or of Westminster,
though Charles still gave Louis a free hand in his aggressive
policy towards the Netherlands, and the Cabal was driven
from office. Danby (afterwards duke of Leeds) now became
chief minister; but, though in reality a strong supporter of the
national policy, he could not hope to keep his place without
acquiescence in the king&rsquo;s schemes. In November 1675 Charles
again prorogued parliament, and did not summon it again till
February 1677, when it was almost immediately prorogued.
On the 17th of February 1676, with Danby&rsquo;s knowledge, Charles
concluded a further treaty with Louis by which he undertook to
subordinate entirely his foreign policy to that of France, and
received an annual pension of £100,000. On the other hand,
Danby succeeded in effecting the marriage (4th of November
1677) between William of Orange and the princess Mary, which
proved the most important political event in the whole reign.
Louis revenged himself by intriguing with the Opposition and
by turning his streams of gold in that direction, and a further
treaty with France for the annual payment to Charles of £300,000
and the dismissal of his parliament, concluded on the 17th of
May 1678, was not executed. Louis made peace with Holland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page915" id="page915"></a>915</span>
at Nijmwegen on the 10th of August, and punished Danby by
disclosing his secret negotiations, thus causing the minister&rsquo;s
fall and impeachment. To save Danby Charles now prorogued
the parliament on the 30th of December, dissolving it on the 24th
of January 1679.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;Popish Plot,&rdquo; the creation of a band of
impostors encouraged by Shaftesbury and the most violent
and unscrupulous of the extreme Protestant party in order
to exclude James from the throne, had thrown the whole
country into a panic. Charles&rsquo;s conduct in this conjuncture
was highly characteristic and was marked by his usual cynical
selfishness. He carefully refrained from incurring suspicion
and unpopularity by opposing the general outcry, and though
he saw through the imposture from the beginning he made no
attempt to moderate the popular frenzy or to save the life of any
of the victims, his co-religionists, not even intervening in the
case of Lord Stafford, and allowing Titus Oates to be lodged
at Whitehall with a pension. His policy was to take advantage
of the violence of the faction, to &ldquo;give them line enough,&rdquo;
to use his own words, to encourage it rather than repress it,
with the expectation of procuring finally a strong royalist reaction.
In his resistance to the great movement for the exclusion
of James from the succession, Charles was aided by moderate
men such as Halifax, who desired only a restriction of James&rsquo;s
powers, and still more by the violence of the extreme exclusionists
themselves, who headed by Shaftesbury brought about their
own downfall and that of their cause by their support of the
legitimacy and claims of Charles&rsquo;s natural son, the duke of
Monmouth. In 1679 Charles denied, in council, his supposed
marriage with Lucy Walter, Monmouth&rsquo;s mother, his declarations
being published in 1680 to refute the legend of the black box
which was supposed to contain the contract of marriage, and
told Burnet he would rather see him hanged than legitimize him.
He deprived him of his general&rsquo;s commission in consequence
of his quasi-royal progresses about the country, and in December
on Monmouth&rsquo;s return to England he was forbidden to appear at
court. In February 1679 the king had consented to order James
to go abroad, and even approved of the attempt of the primate
and the bishop of Winchester to convert him to Protestantism.
To weaken the opposition to his government Charles accepted
Sir W Temple&rsquo;s new scheme of governing by a council which included
the leaders of the Opposition, and which might have become
a rival to the parliament, but this was an immediate failure.
In May 1679 he prorogued the new parliament which had
attainted Danby, and in July dissolved it, while in October he
prorogued another parliament of the same mind till January and
finally till October 1680, having resolved &ldquo;to wait till this violence
should wear off.&rdquo; He even made overtures to Shaftesbury in
November 1679, but the latter insisted on the departure of both
the queen and James. All attempts at compromise failed, and
on the assembling of the parliament in October 1680 the Exclusion
Bill passed the Commons, being, however, thrown out in the Lords
through the influence of Halifax. Charles dissolved the parliament
in January 1681, declaring that he would never give his
consent to the Exclusion Bill, and summoned another at Oxford,
which met there on the 21st of March 1681, Shaftesbury&rsquo;s faction
arriving accompanied by armed bands. Charles expressed his
willingness to consent to the handing over of the administration
to the control of a Protestant, in the case of a Roman Catholic
sovereign, but the Opposition insisted on Charles&rsquo;s nomination
of Monmouth as his successor, and the parliament was accordingly
once more (28th of March) dissolved by Charles, while a royal
proclamation ordered to be read in all the churches proclaimed
the ill-deeds of the parliament and the king&rsquo;s affection for the
Protestant religion.</p>

<p>Charles&rsquo;s tenacity and clever tact were now rewarded. A
great popular reaction ensued in favour of the monarchy, and
a large number of loyal addresses were sent in, most of them
condemning the Exclusion Bill. Shaftesbury was imprisoned,
and though the Middlesex jury threw out his indictment and
he was liberated, he never recovered his power, and in October
1682 left England for ever. The Exclusion Bill and the limitation
of James&rsquo;s powers were no more heard of, and full liberty was
granted to the king to pursue the retrograde and arbitrary policy
to which his disposition naturally inclined. In Scotland James
set up a tyrannical administration of the worst type. The royal
enmity towards William of Orange was increased by a visit of
the latter to England in July. No more parliaments were called,
and Charles subsisted on his permanent revenue and his French
pensions. He continued the policy of double-dealing and
treachery, deceiving his ministers as at the treaty of Dover,
by pretending to support Holland and Spain while he was
secretly engaged to Louis to betray them. On the 22nd of March
1681 he entered into a compact with Louis whereby he undertook
to desert his allies and offer no resistance to French aggressions.
In August he joined with Spain and Holland in a manifesto
against France, while secretly for a million livres he engaged
himself to Louis, and in 1682 he proposed himself as arbitrator
with the intention of treacherously handing over Luxemburg
to France, an offer which was rejected owing to Spanish suspicions
of collusion. In the event, Charles&rsquo;s duplicity enabled Louis to
seize Strassburg in 1681 and Luxemburg in 1684. The government
at home was carried on principally by Rochester, Sunderland
and Godolphin, while Guilford was lord chancellor and
Jeffreys lord chief justice. The laws against the Nonconformists
were strictly enforced. In order to obtain servile parliaments and
also obsequious juries, who with the co-operation of judges of the
stamp of Jeffreys could be depended upon to carry out the wishes
of the court, the borough charters were confiscated, the charter
of the city of London being forfeited on the 12th of June 1683.</p>

<p>The popularity of Charles, now greatly increased, was raised
to national enthusiasm by the discovery of the Rye House plot
in 1683, said to be a scheme to assassinate Charles and James
at an isolated house on the high road near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire
as they returned from Newmarket to London, among
those implicated being Algernon Sidney, Lord Russell and
Monmouth, the two former paying the death penalty and
Monmouth being finally banished to the Hague. The administration
became more and more despotic, and Tangier was abandoned
in order to reduce expenses and to increase the forces at home
for overawing opposition. The first preliminary steps were now
taken for the reintroduction of the Roman Catholic religion.
Danby and those confined on account of participation in the
popish plot were liberated, and Titus Oates thrown into prison.
A scheme was announced for withdrawing the control of the army
in Ireland from Rochester, the lord-lieutenant, and placing it in
the king&rsquo;s own hands, and the commission to which the king had
delegated ecclesiastical patronage was revoked. In May 1684
the office of lord high admiral, in spite of the Test Act, was again
given to James, who had now returned from Scotland. To all
appearances the same policy afterwards pursued so recklessly
and disastrously by James was now cautiously initiated by
Charles, who, however, not being inspired by the same religious
zeal as his brother, and not desiring &ldquo;to go on his travels again,&rdquo;
would probably have drawn back prudently before his throne
was endangered. The developments of this movement were,
however, now interrupted by the death of Charles after a short
illness on the 6th of February 1685. He was buried on the 17th
in Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel in Westminster Abbey with funeral
ceremonies criticized by contemporaries as mean and wanting
in respect, but the scantiness of which was probably owing to
the fact that he had died a Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>On his death-bed Charles had at length declared himself an
adherent of that religion and had received the last rites according
to the Romanist usage. There appears to be no trustworthy
record of his formal conversion, assigned to various times and
various agencies. As a youth, says Clarendon, &ldquo;the ill-bred
familiarity of the Scotch divines had given him a distaste&rdquo; for
Presbyterianism, which he indeed declared &ldquo;no religion for
gentlemen,&rdquo; and the mean figure which the fallen national
church made in exile repelled him at the same time that he was
attracted by the &ldquo;genteel part of the Catholic religion.&rdquo; With
Charles religion was not the serious matter it was with James,
and was largely regarded from the political aspect and from that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page916" id="page916"></a>916</span>
of ease and personal convenience. Presbyterianism constituted
a dangerous encroachment on the royal prerogative; the national
church and the cavalier party were indeed the natural supporters
of the authority of the crown, but on the other hand they refused
to countenance the dependence upon France; Roman Catholicism
at that moment was the obvious medium of governing
without parliaments, of French pensions and of reigning without
trouble, and was naturally the faith of Charles&rsquo;s choice. Of the
two papers in defence of the Roman Catholic religion in Charles&rsquo;s
own hand, published by James, Halifax says &ldquo;though neither
his temper nor education made him very fit to be an author,
yet in this case ... he might write it all himself and yet not
one word of it his own....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of his amours and mistresses the same shrewd observer of
human character, who was also well acquainted with the king,
declares &ldquo;that his inclinations to love were the effects of health
and a good constitution with as little mixture of the <i>seraphic</i>
part as ever man had.... I am apt to think his stayed as much
as any man&rsquo;s ever did in the <i>lower</i> region.&rdquo; His health was the
one subject to which he gave unremitting attention, and his fine
constitution and devotion to all kinds of sport and physical
exercise kept off the effects of uncontrolled debauchery for
thirty years. In later years the society of his mistresses seems
to have been chiefly acceptable as a means to avoid business
and petitioners, and in the case of the duchess of Portsmouth
was the price paid for ease and the continuance of the French
pensions. His ministers he never scrupled to sacrifice to his ease.
The love of ease exercised an entire sovereignty in his thoughts.
&ldquo;The motive of his giving bounties was rather to make men
less uneasy to him than more easy to themselves.&rdquo; He would
rob his own treasury and take bribes to press a measure through
the council. He had a natural affability, but too general to be
much valued, and he was fickle and deceitful. Neither gratitude
nor revenge moved him, and good or ill services left little impression
on his mind. Halifax, however, concludes by desiring
to moderate the roughness of his picture by emphasizing the
excellence of his intellect and memory and his mechanical talent,
by deprecating a too censorious judgment and by dwelling upon
the disadvantages of his bringing up, the difficulties and temptations
of his position, and on the fact that his vices were those
common to human frailty. His capacity for king-craft, knowledge
of the world, and easy address enabled him to surmount
difficulties and dangers which would have proved fatal to his
father or to his brother. &ldquo;It was a common saying that he
could send away a person better pleased at receiving nothing
than those in the good king his father&rsquo;s time that had requests
granted them,&rdquo;<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and his good-humoured tact and familiarity
compensated for and concealed his ingratitude and perfidy and
preserved his popularity. He had good taste in art and literature,
was fond of chemistry and science, and the Royal Society was
founded in his reign. According to Evelyn he was &ldquo;débonnaire
and easy of access, naturally kind-hearted and possessed an
excellent temper,&rdquo; virtues which covered a multitude of sins.</p>

<p>These small traits of amiability, however, which pleased his
contemporaries, cannot disguise for us the broad lines of Charles&rsquo;s
career and character. How far the extraordinary corruption
of private morals which has gained for the restoration period
so unenviable a notoriety was owing to the king&rsquo;s own example
of flagrant debauchery, how far to the natural reaction from an
artificial Puritanism, is uncertain, but it is incontestable that
Charles&rsquo;s cynical selfishness was the chief cause of the degradation
of public life which marks his reign, and of the disgraceful and
unscrupulous betrayal of the national interests which raised
France to a threatening predominance and imperilled the very
existence of Britain for generations. The reign of his predecessor
Charles I., and even of that of his successor James II., with
their mistaken principles and ideals, have a saving dignity
wholly wanting in that of Charles II., and the administration
of Cromwell, in spite of the popularity of the restoration, was
soon regretted. &ldquo;A lazy Prince,&rdquo; writes Pepys, &ldquo;no Council,
no money, no reputation at home or abroad. It is strange

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES I.<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> and <span class="bold">II</span>., kings of France. By the French, Charles
the Great, Roman emperor and king of the Franks, is reckoned the
first of the series of French kings named Charles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Charlemagne</a></span>).
Similarly the emperor Charles II. the Bald (<i>q.v.</i>) is
reckoned as Charles II. of France. In some enumerations the
emperor Charles III. the Fat (<i>q.v.</i>) is reckoned as Charles II. of
France, Charlemagne not being included in the list, and Charles
the Bald being styled Charles I.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES III.,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> the Simple (879-929), king of France, was a
posthumous son of Louis the Stammerer and of his second wife
Adelaide. On the deposition of Charles the Fat in 887 he was
excluded from the throne by his youth; but during the reign of
Odo, who had succeeded Charles, he succeeded in gaining the
recognition of a certain number of notables and in securing his
coronation at Reims on the 28th of January 893. He now
obtained the alliance of the emperor, and forced Odo to cede
part of Neustria. In 898, by the death of his rival (Jan. 1), he
obtained possession of the whole kingdom. His most important
act was the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with the Normans in
911. Some of them were baptized; the territory which was
afterwards known as the duchy of Normandy was ceded to them;
but the story of the marriage of their chief Rollo with a sister of
the king, related by the chronicler Dudo of Saint Quentin, is
very doubtful. The same year Charles, on the invitation of the
barons, took possession of the kingdom of Lotharingia. In 920
the barons, jealous of the growth of the royal authority and
discontented with the favour shown by the king to his counsellor
Hagano, rebelled, and in 922 elected Robert, brother of King
Odo, in place of Charles. Robert was killed in the battle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page917" id="page917"></a>917</span>
Soissons, but the victory remained with his party, who elected
Rudolph, duke of Burgundy, king. In his extremity Charles
trusted himself to Herbert, count of Vermandois, who deceived
him, and threw him into confinement at Château-Thierry and
afterwards at Péronne. In the latter town he died on the 7th
of October 929. In 907 he had married Frederona, sister of
Bovo, bishop of Chalons. After her death he married Eadgyfu
(Odgiva), daughter of Edward the Elder, king of the English, who
was the mother of Louis IV.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IV.<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (1294-1328), king of France, called <span class="sc">The Fair</span>,
was the third and youngest son of Philip IV. and Jeanne of
Navarre. In 1316 he was created count of La Marche, and
succeeded his brother Philip V. as king of France and Navarre
early in 1322. He followed the policy of his predecessors in
enforcing the royal authority over the nobles, but the machinery
of a centralized government strong enough to hold nobility
in check increased the royal expenditure, to meet which Charles
had recourse to doubtful financial expedients. At the beginning
of his reign he ordered a recast of the coinage, with serious
results to commerce; civil officials were deprived of offices,
which had been conferred free, but were now put up to auction;
duties were imposed on exported merchandise and on goods
brought into Paris; the practice of exacting heavy fines was
encouraged by making the salaries of the magistrates dependent
on them; and on the pretext of a crusade to free Armenia from
the Turks, Charles obtained from the pope a tithe levied on the
clergy, the proceeds of which he kept for his own use; he also
confiscated the property of the Lombard bankers who had been
invited to France by his father at a time of financial crisis. The
history of the assemblies summoned by Charles IV. is obscure,
but in 1326, on the outbreak of war with England, an assembly
of prelates and barons met at Meaux. Commissioners were
afterwards despatched to the provinces to state the position of
affairs and to receive complaints. The king justified his failure
to summon the estates on the ground of the expense incurred
by provincial deputies. The external politics of his reign were
not marked by any striking events. He maintained excellent
relations with Pope John XXII., who made overtures to him,
indirectly, offering his support in case of his candidature for the
imperial crown. Charles tried to form a party in Italy in support
of the pope against the emperor Louis IV. of Bavaria, but
failed. A treaty with the English which secured the district
of Agenais for France was followed by a feudal war in Guienne.
Isabella, Charles&rsquo;s sister and the wife of Edward II., was sent
to France to negotiate, and with her brother&rsquo;s help arranged the
final conspiracy against her husband. Charles&rsquo;s first wife was
Blanche, daughter of Otto IV., count of Burgundy, and of
Matilda (Mahaut), countess of Artois, to whom he was married
in 1307. In May 1314, by order of King Philip IV., she was
arrested and imprisoned in the Château-Gaillard with her sister-in-law
Marguerite, daughter of Robert II., duke of Burgundy,
and wife of Louis Hutin, on the charge of adultery with two
gentlemen of the royal household, Philippe and Gautier d&rsquo;Aunai.
Jeanne, sister of Marguerite and wife of Philip the Tall, was
also arrested for not having denounced the culprits, and imprisoned
at Dourdan. The two knights were put to the torture
and executed, and their goods confiscated. It is impossible
to say how far the charges were true. Tradition has involved
and obscured the story, which is the origin of the legend of the
<i>tour de Nesle</i> made famous by the drama of A. Dumas the elder.
Marguerite died shortly in prison; Jeanne was declared innocent
by the parlement and returned to her husband. Blanche was
still in prison when Charles became king. He induced Pope
John XXII. to declare the marriage null, on the ground that
Blanche&rsquo;s mother had been his godmother. Blanche died in
1326, still in confinement, though at the last in the abbey of
Maubuisson.</p>

<p>In 1322, freed from his first marriage, Charles married his
cousin Mary of Luxemburg, daughter of the emperor Henry VII.,
and upon her death, two years later, Jeanne, daughter of Louis,
count of Evreux. Charles IV. died at Vincennes on the 1st of
February 1328. He left no issue by his first two wives to succeed
him, and daughters only by Jeanne of Evreux. He was the last
of the direct line of Capetians.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES V.<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1337-1380), king of France, called <span class="sc">The Wise</span>,
was born at the château of Vincennes on the 21st of January
1337, the son of John II. and Bonne of Luxemburg. In 1349
he became dauphin of the Viennois by purchase from Humbert
II., and in 1355 he was created duke of Normandy. At the battle
of Poitiers (1356) his father ordered him to leave the field when
the battle turned against the French, and he was thus saved
from the imprisonment that overtook his father. After arranging
for the government of Normandy he proceeded to Paris, where
he took the title of lieutenant of the kingdom. During the years
of John II.&rsquo;s imprisonment in England Charles was virtually
king of France. He summoned the states-general of northern
France (Langue d&rsquo;oïl) to Paris in October 1356 to obtain men and
money to carry on the war. But under the leadership of Étienne
Marcel, provost of the Parisian merchants and president of the
third estate, and Robert le Coq, bishop of Laon, president of the
clergy, a partisan of Charles of Navarre, the states refused any
&ldquo;aid&rdquo; except on conditions which Charles declined to accept.
They demanded the dismissal of a number of the royal ministers;
the establishment of a commission elected from the three estates
to regulate the dauphin&rsquo;s administration, and of another board
to act as council of war; also the release of Charles the Bad,
king of Navarre, who had been imprisoned by King John. The
estates of Languedoc, summoned to Toulouse, also made protests
against misgovernment, but they agreed to raise a war-levy on
terms to which the dauphin acceded. Charles sought the
alliance of his uncle, the emperor Charles IV., to whom he did
homage at Metz as dauphin of the Viennois, and he was also made
imperial vicar of Dauphiné, thus acknowledging the imperial
jurisdiction. But he gained small material advantage from
these proceedings. The states-general were again convoked
in February 1357. Their demands were more moderate than
in the preceding year, but they nominated members to replace
certain obnoxious persons on the royal council, demanded the
right to assemble without the royal summons, and certain
administrative reforms. In return they promised to raise and
finance an army of 30,000 men, but the money&mdash;a tithe levied
on the annual revenues of the clergy and nobility&mdash;voted for
this object was not to pass through the dauphin&rsquo;s hands. Charles
appeared to consent, but the agreement was annulled by letters
from King John, announcing at the same time the conclusion
of a two years&rsquo; truce, and the reformers failed to secure their
ends. Charles had escaped from their power by leaving Paris,
but he returned for a new meeting of the estates in the autumn
of 1357.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles of Navarre had been released by his partisans,
and allying himself with Marcel had become a popular
hero in Paris. The dauphin was obliged to receive him and to
undergo an apparent reconciliation. In Paris Étienne Marcel
was supreme. He forced his way into the dauphin&rsquo;s palace
(February 1358), and Charles&rsquo;s servant, Jean de Conflans,
marshal of Champagne, and Robert de Clermont, marshal of
Normandy, were murdered before his eyes. Charles was powerless
openly to resent these outrages, but he obtained from the
provincial assemblies the money refused him by the states-general,
and deferred his vengeance until the dissensions of his
enemies should offer him an opportunity. Charles of Navarre,
now in league with the English and master of lower Normandy
and of the approaches to Paris, returned to the immediate
neighbourhood of the city, and Marcel found himself driven to
avowed co-operation with the dauphin&rsquo;s enemies, the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page918" id="page918"></a>918</span>
and the Navarrese. Charles had been compelled in March to
take the title of regent to prevent the possibility of further intervention
from King John. In defiance of a recent ordinance
prohibiting provincial assemblies, he presided over the estates
of Picardy and Artois, and then over those of Champagne.
The states-general of 1358 were summoned to Compiègne instead
of Paris, and granted a large aid. The condition of northern
France was rendered more desperate by the outbreak (May-June
1358) of the peasant revolt known as the Jacquerie, which
was repressed with a barbarity far exceeding the excesses of the
rebels. Within the walls of Paris Jean Maillart had formed a
royalist party; Marcel was assassinated (31st July 1358), and
the dauphin entered Paris in the following month. A reaction
in Charles&rsquo;s favour had set in, and from the estates of 1359 he
regained the authority he had lost. It was with their full concurrence
that he restored their honours to the officials who had
been dismissed by the estates of 1356 and 1357. They supported
him in repudiating the treaty of London (1359), which King John
had signed in anxiety for his personal freedom, and voted money
unconditionally for the continuation of the war. From this time
the estates were only once convoked by Charles, who contented
himself thenceforward by appeals to the assembly of notables
or to the provincial bodies. Charles of Navarre was now at open
war with the regent; Edward III. landed at Calais in October;
and a great part of the country was exposed to double depredations
from the English and the Navarrese troops. In the scarcity
of money Charles had recourse to the debasement of the coinage,
which suffered no less than twenty-two variations in the two years
before the treaty of Brétigny. This disastrous financial expedient
was made good later, the coinage being established on a firm
basis during the last sixteen years of Charles&rsquo;s reign in accordance
with the principles of Nicolas Oresme. On the conclusion of
peace King John was restored to France, but, being unable to
raise his ransom, he returned in 1364 to England, where he died
in April, leaving the crown to Charles, who was crowned at
Reims on the 19th of May.</p>

<p>The new king found an able servant in Bertrand du Guesclin,
who won a victory over the Navarrese troops at Cocherel and
took prisoner their best general, Jean de Grailli, captal of Buch.
The establishment of Charles&rsquo;s brother, Philip the Bold, in the
duchy of Burgundy, though it constituted in the event a serious
menace to the monarchy, put an end to the king of Navarre&rsquo;s
ambitions in that direction. A treaty of peace between the two
kings was signed in 1365, by which Charles of Navarre gave up
Mantes, Meulan and the county of Longueville in exchange for
Montpellier. Negotiations were renewed in 1370 when Charles
of Navarre did homage for his French possessions, though he
was then considering an offensive and defensive alliance with
Edward III. Du Guesclin undertook to free France from the
depredations of the &ldquo;free companies,&rdquo; mercenary soldiers put
out of employment by the cessation of the war. An attempt
to send them on a crusade against the Turks failed, and Du
Guesclin led them to Spain to put Henry of Trastamara on the
throne of Castile. By the marriage of his brother Philip the
Bold with Margaret of Flanders, Charles detached the Flemings
from the English alliance, and as soon as he had restored
something like order in the internal affairs of the kingdom he
provoked a quarrel with the English. The text of the treaty of
Brétigny presented technical difficulties of which Charles was
not slow to avail himself. The English power in Guienne was
weakened by the disastrous Spanish expedition of the Black
Prince, whom Charles summoned before the parlement of Paris
in January 1369 to answer the charges preferred against him
by his subjects, thus expressly repudiating the English supremacy
in Guienne. War was renewed in May after a meeting of
the states-general. Between 1371 and 1373 Poitou and Saintonge
were reconquered by Du Guesclin, and soon the English
had to abandon all their territory north of the Garonne. John
IV. of Brittany (Jean de Montfort) had won his duchy with
English help by the defeat of Charles of Blois, the French
nominee, at Auray in 1364. His sympathies remained English,
but he was now (1373) obliged to take refuge in England, and
later in Flanders, while the English only retained a footing in
two or three coast towns. Charles&rsquo;s generals avoided pitched
battles, and contented themselves with defensive and guerrilla
tactics, with the result that in 1380 only Bayonne, Bordeaux,
Brest and Calais were still in English hands.</p>

<p>Charles had in 1378 obtained proof of Charles of Navarre&rsquo;s
treasonable designs. He seized the Norman towns held by the
Navarrese, while Henry of Trastamara invaded Navarre, and
imposed conditions of peace which rendered his lifelong enemy
at last powerless. A premature attempt to amalgamate the
duchy of Brittany with the French crown failed. Charles summoned
the duke to Paris in 1378, and on his non-appearance
committed one of his rare errors of policy by confiscating his
duchy. But the Bretons rose to defend their independence, and
recalled their duke. The matter was still unsettled when Charles
died at Vincennes on the 16th of September 1380. His health,
always delicate, had been further weakened, according to
popular report, by a slow poison prepared for him by the king
of Navarre. His wife, Jeanne of Bourbon, died in 1378, and
the succession devolved on their elder son Charles, a boy of
twelve. Their younger son was Louis, duke of Orleans.</p>

<p>Personally Charles was no soldier. He owed the signal successes
of his reign partly to his skilful choice of advisers and
administrators, to his chancellors Jean and Guillaume de Dormans
and Pierre d&rsquo;Orgemont, to Hugues Aubriot, provost of
Paris, Bureau de la Riviere and others; partly to a singular
coolness and subtlety in the exercise of a not over-scrupulous
diplomacy, which made him a dangerous enemy. He had learnt
prudence and self-restraint in the troubled times of the regency,
and did not lose his moderation in success. He modelled his
private life on that of his predecessor Saint Louis, but was no
fanatic in religion, for he refused his support to the violent
methods of the Inquisition in southern France, and allowed the
Jews to return to the country, at the same time confirming their
privileges. His support of the schismatic pope Clement VII.
at Avignon was doubtless due to political considerations, as
favouring the independence of the Gallican church. Charles V.
was a student of astrology, medicine, law and philosophy, and
collected a large and valuable library at the Louvre. He
gathered round him a group of distinguished writers and thinkers,
among whom were Raoul de Presles, Philippe de Mézières,
Nicolas Oresme and others. The ideas of these men were applied
by him to the practical work of administration, though he confined
himself chiefly to the consolidation and improvement of
existing institutions. The power of the nobility was lessened
by restrictions which, without prohibiting private wars, made
them practically impossible. The feudal fortresses were regularly
inspected by the central authority, and the nobles themselves
became in many cases paid officers of the king. Charles
established a merchant marine and a formidable navy, which
under Jean de Vienne threatened the English coast between
1377 and 1380. The states-general were silenced and the royal
prerogative increased; the royal domains were extended, and
the wealth of the crown was augmented; additions were made
to the revenue by the sale of municipal charters and patents;
and taxation became heavier, since Charles set no limits to the
gratification of his tastes either in the collection of jewels and
precious objects, of books, or of his love of building, examples
of which are the renovation of the Louvre and the erection of
the palace of Saint Paul in Paris.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES VI.<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1368-1422), king of France, son of Charles V.
and Jeanne of Bourbon, was born in Paris on the 3rd of December
1368. He received the appanage of Dauphiné at his birth, and
was thus the first of the princes of France to bear the title of
dauphin from infancy. Charles V. had entrusted his education
to Philippe de Mézières, and had fixed his majority at fourteen.
He succeeded to the throne in 1380, at the age of twelve, and
the royal authority was divided between his paternal uncles,
Louis, duke of Anjou, John, duke of Berry, Philip the Bold, duke
of Burgundy, and his mother&rsquo;s brother, Louis II., duke of Bourbon.
In accordance with an ordinance of the late king the duke of
Anjou became regent, while the guardianship of the young king,
together with the control of Paris and Normandy, passed to the
dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon, who were to be assisted by
certain of the councillors of Charles V. The duke of Berry,
excluded by this arrangement, was compensated by the government
of Languedoc and Guienne. Anjou held the regency for
a few months only, until the king&rsquo;s coronation in November 1380.
He enriched himself from the estate of Charles V. and by excessive
exactions, before he set out in 1382 for Italy to effect the
conquest of Naples. Considerable discontent existed in the south
of France at the time of the death of Charles V., and when the
duke of Anjou re-imposed certain taxes which the late king had
remitted at the end of his reign, there were revolts at Puy and
Montpellier. Paris, Rouen, the cities of Flanders, with Amiens,
Orleans, Reims and other French towns, also rose (1382) in revolt
against their masters. The <i>Maillotins</i>, as the Parisian insurgents
were named from the weapon they used, gained the upper
hand in Paris, and were able temporarily to make terms, but
the commune of Rouen was abolished, and the <i>Tuchins</i>, as
the marauders in Languedoc were called, were pitilessly hunted
down. Charles VI. marched to the help of the count of Flanders
against the insurgents headed by Philip van Artevelde, and
gained a complete victory at Roosebeke (November 27th, 1382).
Strengthened by this success the king, on his return to Paris
in the following January, exacted vengeance on the citizens by
fines, executions and the suppression of the privileges of the city.
The help sent by the English to the Flemish cities resulted
in a second Flemish campaign. In 1385 Jean de Vienne made
an unsuccessful descent on the Scottish coast, and Charles
equipped a fleet at Sluys for the invasion of England, but
a series of delays ended in the destruction of the ships by the
English.</p>

<p>In 1385 Charles VI. married Elizabeth, daughter of Stephen II.,
duke of Bavaria, her name being gallicized as Isabeau. Three
years later, with the help of his brother, Louis of Orleans, duke
of Touraine, he threw off the tutelage of his uncles, whom he
replaced by Bureau de la Rivière and others among his father&rsquo;s
counsellors, nicknamed by the royal princes the <i>marmousets</i>
because of their humble origin. Two years later he deprived
the duke of Berry of the government of Languedoc. The opening
years of Charles VI.&rsquo;s effective rule promised well, but excess in
gaiety of all kinds undermined his constitution, and in 1392 he
had an attack of madness at Le Mans, when on his way to
Brittany to force from John V. the surrender of his cousin
Pierre de Craon, who had tried to assassinate the constable
Olivier de Clisson in the streets of Paris. Other attacks followed,
and it became evident that Charles was unable permanently to
sustain the royal authority. Clisson, Bureau de la Rivière,
Jean de Mercier, and the other <i>marmousets</i> were driven from
office, and the royal dukes regained their power. The rivalries
between the most powerful of these&mdash;the duke of Burgundy,
who during the king&rsquo;s attacks of madness practically ruled the
country, and the duke of Orleans&mdash;were a constant menace to
peace. In 1306 peace with England seemed assured by the
marriage of Richard II. with Charles VI.&rsquo;s daughter Isabella,
but the Lancastrian revolution of 1399 destroyed the diplomatic
advantages gained by this union. In France the country was
disturbed by the papal schism. At an assembly of the clergy
held in Paris in 1398 it was resolved to refuse to recognize the
authority of Benedict XIII., who succeeded Clement VII. as
schismatic pope at Avignon. The question became a party
one; Benedict was supported by Louis of Orleans, while Philip
the Bold and the university of Paris opposed him. Obedience
to Benedict&rsquo;s authority was resumed in 1403, only to be withdrawn
again in 1408, when the king declared himself the guardian
and protector of the French church, which was indeed for a
time self-governing. Edicts further extending the royal power
in ecclesiastical affairs were even issued in 1418, after the schism
was at an end.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s intelligence became yearly feebler, and in 1404
the death of Philip the Bold aggravated the position of affairs.
The new duke, John the Fearless, did not immediately replace his
father in general affairs, and the influence of the duke of Orleans
increased. Queen Isabeau, who had generally supported the
Burgundian party, was now practically separated from her
husband, whose madness had become pronounced. She was
replaced by a young Burgundian lady, Odette de Champdivers,
called by her contemporaries <i>la petite reine</i>, who rescued the king
from the state of neglect into which he had fallen. Isabeau of
Bavaria was freely accused of intrigue with the duke of Orleans.
She was from time to time regent of France, and as her policy
was directed by personal considerations and by her love of
splendour she further added to the general distress. The relations
between John the Fearless and the duke of Orleans became more
embittered, and on the 23rd of November 1407 Orleans was
murdered in the streets of Paris at the instigation of his rival.
The young duke Charles of Orleans married the daughter of the
Gascon count Bernard VII. of Armagnac, and presently formed
alliances with the dukes of Berry, Bourbon and Brittany, and
others who formed the party known as the Armagnacs (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Armagnac</a></span>), against the Burgundians who had gained the upper
hand in the royal council. In 1411 John the Fearless contracted
an alliance with Henry IV. of England, and civil war began in
the autumn, but in 1412 the Armagnacs in their turn sought
English aid, and, by promising the sovereignty of Aquitaine
to the English king, gave John the opportunity of posing as
defender of France. In Paris the Burgundians were hand
in hand with the corporation of the butchers, who were the
leaders of the Parisian populace. The malcontents, who took
their name from one of their number, Caboche, penetrated into
the palace of the dauphin Louis, and demanded the surrender
of the unpopular members of his household. A royal ordinance,
promising reforms in administration, was promulgated on the
27th of May 1413, and some of the royal advisers were executed.
The king and the dauphin, powerless in the hands of Duke
John and the Parisians, appealed secretly to the Armagnac
princes for deliverance. They entered Paris in September; the
ordinance extracted by the Cabochiens was rescinded; and
numbers of the insurgents were banished the city.</p>

<p>In the next year Henry V. of England, after concluding an
alliance with Burgundy, resumed the pretensions of Edward III.
to the crown of France, and in 1415 followed the disastrous
battle of Agincourt. The two elder sons of Charles VI., Louis,
duke of Guienne, and John, duke of Touraine, died in 1415 and
1417, and Charles, count of Ponthieu, became heir apparent.
Paris was governed by Bernard of Armagnac, constable of
France, who expelled all suspected of Burgundian sympathies
and treated Paris like a conquered city. Queen Isabeau was
imprisoned at Tours, but escaped to Burgundy. The capture
of Paris by the Burgundians on the 20th of May 1418 was
followed by a series of horrible massacres of the Armagnacs;
and in July Duke John and Isabeau, who assumed the title
of regent, entered Paris. Meanwhile Henry V. had completed
the conquest of Normandy. The murder of John the Fearless in
1419 under the eyes of the dauphin Charles threw the Burgundians
definitely into the arms of the English, and his successor
Philip the Good, in concert with Queen Isabeau, concluded
(1420) the treaty of Troyes with Henry V., who became master
of France. Charles VI. had long been of no account in the
government, and the state of neglect in which he existed at
Senlis induced Henry V. to undertake the re-organization of
his household. He came to Paris in September 1422, and died
on the 21st of October.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES VII.<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1403-1461), king of France, fifth son of
Charles VI. and Isabeau of Bavaria, was born in Paris on the
22nd of February 1403. The count of Ponthieu, as he was
called in his boyhood, was betrothed in 1413 to Mary of Anjou,
daughter of Louis II., duke of Anjou and king of Sicily, and
spent the next two years at the Angevin court. He received
the duchy of Touraine in 1416, and in the next year the death
of his brother John made him dauphin of France. He became
lieutenant-general of the kingdom in 1417, and made active
efforts to combat the complaisance of his mother. He assumed
the title of regent in December 1418, but his authority in northern
France was paralysed in 1419 by the murder of John the Fearless,
duke of Burgundy, in his presence at Montereau. Although the
deed was not apparently premeditated, as the English and
Burgundians declared, it ruined Charles&rsquo;s cause for the time.
He was disinherited by the treaty of Troyes in 1420, and at the
time of his father&rsquo;s death in 1422 had retired to Mehun-sur-Yèvre,
near Bourges, which had been the nominal seat of government
since 1418. He was recognized as king in Touraine, Berry and
Poitou, in Languedoc and other provinces of southern France;
but the English power in the north was presently increased by
the provinces of Champagne and Maine, as the result of the
victories of Crevant (1423) and Verneuil (1424). The Armagnac
administrators who had been driven out of Paris by the duke
of Bedford gathered round the young king, nicknamed the
&ldquo;king of Bourges,&rdquo; but he was weak in body and mind, and was
under the domination of Jean Louvet and Tanguy du Chastel,
the instigators of the murder of John the Fearless, and other
discredited partisans. The power of these favourites was shaken
by the influence of the queen&rsquo;s mother, Yolande of Aragon,
duchess of Anjou. She sought the alliance of John V., duke of
Brittany, who, however, vacillated throughout his life between
the English and French alliance, concerned chiefly to maintain
the independence of his duchy. His brother, Arthur of Brittany,
earl of Richmond (comte de Richemont), was reconciled with the
king, and became constable in 1425, with the avowed intention
of making peace between Charles VII. and the duke of Burgundy.
Richemont caused the assassination of Charles&rsquo;s favourites
Pierre de Giac and Le Camus de Beaulieu, and imposed one of
his own choosing, Georges de la Trémoille, an adventurer who
rapidly usurped the constable&rsquo;s power. For five years (1427-1432)
a private war between these two exhausted the Armagnac
forces, and central France returned to anarchy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bedford had established settled government
throughout the north of France, and in 1428 he advanced to
the siege of Orleans. For the movement which was to lead to
the deliverance of France from the English invaders, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Joan
of Arc</a></span>. The siege of Orleans was raised by her efforts on the
8th of May 1429, and two months later Charles VII. was crowned
at Reims. Charles&rsquo;s intimate counsellors, La Trémoille and
Regnault de Chartres, archbishop of Reims, saw their profits
menaced by the triumphs of Joan of Arc, and accordingly the
court put every difficulty in the way of her military career, and
received the news of her capture before Compiègne (1430) with
indifference. No measures were taken for her deliverance or her
ransom, and Normandy and the Isle of France remained in
English hands. Fifteen years of anarchy and civil war intervened
before peace was restored. Bands of armed men fighting for
their own hand traversed the country, and in the ten years
between 1434 and 1444 the provinces were terrorized by these
<i>écorcheurs</i>, who, with the decline of discipline in the English army,
were also recruited from the ranks of the invaders. The duke of
Bedford died in 1435, and in the same year Philip the Good of
Burgundy concluded a treaty with Charles VII. at Arras, after
fruitless negotiations for an English treaty. From this time
Charles&rsquo;s policy was strengthened. La Trémoille had been
assassinated in 1433 by the constable&rsquo;s orders, with the connivance
of Yolande of Aragon. For his former favourites were
substituted energetic advisers, his brother-in-law Charles of
Anjou, Dunois (the famous bastard of Orleans), Pierre de Brézé,
Richemont and others. Richemont entered Paris on the 13th
of April 1436, and in the next five years the finance of the
country was re-established on a settled basis. Charles himself
commanded the troops who captured Pontoise in 1441, and in
the next year he made a successful expedition in the south.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princes of the blood and the great nobles
resented the ascendancy of councillors and soldiers drawn from
the smaller nobility and the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. They made a formidable
league against the crown in 1440 which included Charles I.,
duke of Bourbon, John II., duke of Alençon, John IV. of
Armagnac, and the dauphin, afterwards Louis XI. The revolt
broke out in Poitou in 1440 and was known as the <i>Praguerie</i>.
Charles VII. repressed the rising, and showed great skill with
the rebel nobles, finally buying them over individually by considerable
concessions. In 1444 a truce was concluded with
England at Tours, and Charles proceeded to organize a regular
army. The central authority was gradually made effective, and
a definite system of payment, by removing the original cause of
brigandage, and the establishment of a strict discipline learnt
perhaps from the English troops, gradually stamped out the most
serious of the many evils under which the country had suffered.
Pierre Bessonneau, and the brothers Gaspard and Jean Bureau
created a considerable force of artillery. Domestic troubles in
their own country weakened the English in France. The conquest
of Normandy was completed by the battle of Formigny
(15th of April 1450). Guienne was conquered in 1451 by Duncis,
but not subdued, and another expedition was necessary in 1453,
when Talbot was defeated and slain at Castillon. Meanwhile
in 1450 Charles VII. had resolved on the rehabilitation of Joan
of Arc, thus rendering a tardy recognition of her services. This
was granted in 1456 by the Holy See. The only foothold retained
by the English on French ground was Calais. In its earlier
stages the deliverance of France from the English had been the
work of the people themselves. The change which made Charles
take an active part in public affairs is said to have been largely
due to the influence of Agnes Sorel, who became his mistress in
1444 and died in 1450. She was the first to play a public and
political rôle as mistress of a king of France, and may be said to
have established a tradition. Pierre de Brézé, who had had a
large share in the repression of the Praguerie, obtained through
her a dominating influence over the king, and he inspired the
monarch himself and the whole administration with new vigour.
Charles and René of Anjou retired from court, and the greater
part of the members of the king&rsquo;s council were drawn from the
bourgeois classes. The most famous of all these was Jacques
Coeur (<i>q.v.</i>). It was by the zeal of these councillors that Charles
obtained the surname of &ldquo;The Well-Served.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles VII. continued his father&rsquo;s general policy in church
matters. He desired to lessen the power of the Holy See in
France and to preserve as far as possible the liberties of the
Gallican church. With the council of Constance (1414-1418)
the great schism was practically healed. Charles, while careful
to protest against its renewal, supported the anti-papal contentions
of the French members of the council of Basel (1431-1449),
and in 1438 he promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction at
Bourges, by which the patronage of ecclesiastical benefices was
removed from the Holy See, while certain interventions of the
royal power were admitted. Bishops and abbots were to be
elected, in accordance with ancient custom, by their clergy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page921" id="page921"></a>921</span>
After the English had evacuated French territory Charles still
had to cope with feudal revolt, and with the hostility of the
dauphin, who was in open revolt in 1446, and for the next ten
years ruled like an independent sovereign in Dauphiné. He took
refuge in 1457 with Charles&rsquo;s most formidable enemy, Philip
of Burgundy. Charles VII. nevertheless found means to prevent
Philip from attaining his ambitions in Lorraine and in Germany.
But the dauphin succeeded in embarrassing his father&rsquo;s policy
at home and abroad, and had his own party in the court itself.
Charles VII. died at Mehun-sur-Yévre on the 22nd of July 1461.
He believed that he was poisoned by his son, who cannot, however,
be accused of anything more than an eager expectation
of his death.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The history of the reign of Charles VII. has been
written by two modern historians,&mdash;Vallet de Viriville, <i>Histoire de
Charles VII ... et de son époque</i> (Paris, 3 vols., 1862-1865), and
G. du Fresne de Beaucourt, <i>Hist, de Charles VII</i> (Paris, 6 vols.,
1881-1891). There is abundant contemporary material. The
herald, Jacques le Bouvier or Berry (b. 1386), whose <i>Chronicques du
feu roi Charles VII</i> was first printed in 1528 as the work of Alain
Chartier, was an eye-witness of many of the events he described.
His <i>Recouvrement de Normandie</i>, with other material on the same
subject, was edited for the &ldquo;Rolls&rdquo; series (<i>Chronicles and Memorials</i>)
by Joseph Stevenson in 1863. The <i>Histoire de Charles VII</i> by Jean
Chartier, historiographer-royal from 1437, was included in the
<i>Grandes Chroniques de Saint-Denis</i>, and was first printed under
Chartier&rsquo;s name by Denis Godefroy, together with other contemporary
narratives, in 1661. It was re-edited by Vallet de Viriville (Paris,
3 vols., 1858-1859). With these must be considered the Burgundian
chroniclers Enguerrand de Monstrelet, whose chronicle (ed. L. Douët
d&rsquo;Arcq; Paris, 6 vols., 1857-1862) covers the years 1400-1444, and
Georges Chastellain, the existing fragments of whose chronicle are
published in his <i>&OElig;uvres</i> (ed. Kervyn de Lettenhove; Brussels,
8 vols., 1863-1866). For a detailed bibliography and an account

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES VIII.<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1470-1498), king of France, was the only son
of Louis XI. During the whole of his childhood Charles lived far
from his father at the château of Amboise, which was throughout
his life his favourite residence. On the death of Louis XI in 1483
Charles, a lad of thirteen, was of age, but was absolutely incapable
of governing. Until 1492 he abandoned the government to his
sister Anne of Beaujeu. In 1491 he married Anne, duchess of
Brittany, who was already betrothed to Maximilian of Austria.
Urged by his favourite, Étienne de Vesc, he then, at the age of
twenty-two, threw off the yoke of the Beaujeus, and at the same
time discarded their wise and able policy. But he was a thoroughly
worthless man with a weak and ill-balanced intellect. He had a
romantic imagination and conceived vast projects. He proposed
at first to claim the rights of the house of Anjou, to which Louis
XI. had succeeded, on the kingdom of Naples, and to use this as a
stepping-stone to the capture of Constantinople from the Turks
and his own coronation as emperor of the East. He sacrificed
everything to this adventurous policy, signed disastrous treaties
to keep his hands free, and set out for Italy in 1494. The ceremonial
side of the expedition being in his eyes the most important,
he allowed himself to be intoxicated by his easy triumph and
duped by the Italians. On the 12th of May 1495 he entered
Naples in great pomp, clothed in the imperial insignia. A general
coalition was, however, formed against him, and he was forced
to return precipitately to France. It cannot be denied that he
showed bravery at the battle of Fornovo (the 5th of July 1495).
He was preparing a fresh expedition to Italy, when he died on the
8th of April 1498, from the results of an accident, at the château
of Amboise.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IX.<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1550-1574), king of France, was the third son
of Henry II. and Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. At first he bore the title of
duke of Orleans. He became king in 1560 by the death of his
brother Francis II., but as he was only ten years old the power
was in the hands of the queen-mother, Catherine. Charles seems
to have been a youth of good parts, lively and agreeable, but he
had a weak, passionate and fantastic nature. His education had
spoiled him. He was left to his whims&mdash;even the strangest&mdash;and
to his taste for violent exercises; and the excesses to which he
gave himself up ruined his health. Proclaimed of age on the 17th
of August 1563, he continued to be absorbed in his fantasies and
his hunting, and submitted docilely to the authority of his mother.
In 1570 he was married to Elizabeth of Austria, daughter of
Maximilian II. It was about this time that he dreamed of making
a figure in the world. The successes of his brother, the duke of
Anjou, at Jarnac and Moncontour had already caused him some
jealousy. When Coligny came to court, he received him very
warmly, and seemed at first to accept the idea of an intervention
in the Netherlands against the Spaniards. For the upshot of this
adventure see the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">St Bartholomew, Massacre of</a></span>.
Charles was in these circumstances no hypocrite, but weak,
hesitating and ill-balanced. Moreover, the terrible events in
which he had played a part transformed his character. He
became melancholy, severe and taciturn. &ldquo;It is feared,&rdquo; said the
Venetian ambassador, &ldquo;that he may become cruel.&rdquo; Undermined
by fever, at the age of twenty he had the appearance of an
old man, and night and day he was haunted with nightmares.
He died on the 30th of May 1574. By his mistress, Marie
Touchet, he had one son, Charles, duke of Angoulême. Charles
IX. had a sincere love of letters, himself practised poetry, was the
patron of Ronsard and the poets of the Pleiad, and granted
privileges to the first academy founded by Antoine de Baïf
(afterwards the Académie du Palais). He left a work on hunting,
<i>Traité de la chasse royale</i>, which was published in 1625, and
reprinted in 1859.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES X.<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1757-1836), king of France from 1824 to 1830,
was the fourth child of the dauphin, son of Louis XV. and of
Marie Josephe of Saxony, and consequently brother of Louis XVI.
He was known before his accession as Charles Philippe, count of
Artois. At the age of sixteen he married Marie Thérèse of
Savoy, sister-in-law of his brother, the count of Provence (Louis
XVIII.). His youth was passed in scandalous dissipation, which
drew upon himself and his coterie the detestation of the people of
Paris. Although lacking military tastes, he joined the French
army at the siege of Gibraltar in 1772, merely for distraction.
In a few years he had incurred a debt of 56 million francs, a burden
assumed by the impoverished state. Prior to the Revolution he
took only a minor part in politics, but when it broke out he soon
became, with the queen, the chief of the reactionary party at
court. In July 1789 he left France, became leader of the <i>émigrés</i>,
and visited several of the courts of Europe in the interest of the
royalist cause. After the execution of Louis XVI. he received
from his brother, the count of Provence, the title of lieutenant-general
of the realm, and, on the death of Louis XVII., that of
&ldquo;Monsieur.&rdquo; In 1795 he attempted to aid the royalist rising of
La Vendée, landing at the island of Yeu. But he refused to
advance farther and to put himself resolutely at the head of his
party, although warmly acclaimed by it, and courage failing him,
he returned to England, settling first in London, then in Holyrood
Palace at Edinburgh and afterwards at Hartwell. There he
remained until 1813, returning to France in February 1814,
and entering Paris in April, in the track of the Allies.</p>

<p>During the reign of his brother, Louis XVIII., he was the
leader of the ultra-royalists, the party of extreme reaction. On
succeeding to the throne in September 1824 the dignity of his
address and his affable condescension won him a passing popularity.
But his coronation at Reims, with all the gorgeous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page922" id="page922"></a>922</span>
ceremonial of the old régime, proclaimed his intention of ruling,
as the Most Christian King, by divine right. His first acts,
indeed, allayed the worst alarms of the Liberals; but it was soon
apparent that the weight of the crown would be consistently
thrown into the scale of the reactionary forces. The <i>émigrés</i> were
awarded a milliard as compensation for their confiscated lands;
and Gallicans and Liberals alike were offended by measures
which threw increased power into the hands of the Jesuits and
Ultramontanes. In a few months there were disquieting signs of
the growing unpopularity of the king. The royal princesses were
insulted in the streets; and on the 29th of April 1825 Charles,
when reviewing the National Guard, was met with cries from
the ranks of &ldquo;Down with the ministers!&rdquo; His reply was, next
day, a decree disbanding the citizen army.</p>

<p>It was not till 1829, when the result of the elections had proved
the futility of Villèle&rsquo;s policy of repression, that Charles consented
unwillingly to try a policy of compromise. It was, however, too
late. Villèle&rsquo;s successor was the vicomte de Martignac, who took
Decazes for his model; and in the speech from the throne Charles
declared that the happiness of France depended on &ldquo;the sincere
union of the royal authority with the liberties consecrated by the
charter.&rdquo; But Charles had none of the patience and commonsense
which had enabled Louis XVIII. to play with decency the
part of a constitutional king. &ldquo;I would rather hew wood,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;than be a king under the conditions of the king
of England&rdquo;; and when the Liberal opposition obstructed all
the measures proposed by a ministry not selected from the
parliamentary majority, he lost patience. &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that there was no coming to terms with these men.&rdquo;
Martignac was dismissed; and Prince Jules de Polignac, the
very incarnation of clericalism and reaction, was called to the
helm of state.</p>

<p>The inevitable result was obvious to all the world. &ldquo;There
is no such thing as political experience,&rdquo; wrote Wellington,
certainly no friend of Liberalism; &ldquo;with the warning of James II.
before him, Charles X. was setting up a government by priests,
through priests, for priests.&rdquo; A formidable agitation sprang
up in France, which only served to make the king more obstinate.
In opening the session of 1830 he declared that he would &ldquo;find
the power&rdquo; to overcome the obstacles placed in his path by
&ldquo;culpable manoeuvres.&rdquo; The reply of the chambers was a
protest against &ldquo;the unjust distrust of the sentiment and reason
of France&rdquo;; whereupon they were first prorogued, and on the
16th of May dissolved. The result of the new elections was
what might have been foreseen: a large increase in the Opposition;
and Charles, on the advice of his ministers, determined
on a virtual suspension of the constitution. On the 25th of
July were issued the famous &ldquo;four ordinances&rdquo; which were the
immediate cause of the revolution that followed.</p>

<p>With singular fatuity Charles had taken no precautions in view
of a violent outbreak. Marshal Marmont, who commanded the
scattered troops in Paris, had received no orders, beyond a jesting
command from the duke of Angoulême to place them under arms
&ldquo;as some windows might be broken.&rdquo; At the beginning of the
revolution Charles was at St Cloud, whence on the news of the
fighting he withdrew first to Versailles and then to Rambouillet.
So little did he understand the seriousness of the situation that,
when the laconic message &ldquo;All is over!&rdquo; was brought to him,
he believed that the insurrection had been suppressed. On
realizing the truth he hastily abdicated in favour of his grandson,
the duke of Bordeaux (comte de Chambord), and appointed
Louis Philippe, duke of Orleans, lieutenant-general of the kingdom
(July 30th). But, on the news of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s acceptance
of the crown, he gave up the contest and began a dignified
retreat to the sea-coast, followed by his suite, and surrounded
by the infantry, cavalry and artillery of the guard. Beyond
sending a corps of observation to follow his movements, the new
government did nothing to arrest his escape. At Maintenon
Charles took leave of the bulk of his troops, and proceeding with
an escort of some 1200 men to Cherbourg, took ship there for
England on the 16th of August. For a time he returned to Holyrood
Palace at Edinburgh, which was again placed at his disposal.
He died at Goritz, whither he had gone for his health,
on the 6th of November 1836.</p>

<p>The best that can be said of Charles X. is that, if he did not
know how to rule, he knew how to cease to rule. The dignity
of his exit was more worthy of the ancient splendour of the royal
house of France than the theatrical humility of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s
entrance. But Charles was an impossible monarch for the 19th
century, or perhaps for any other century. He was a typical
Bourbon, unable either to learn or to forget; and the closing
years of his life he spent in religious austerities, intended to
expiate, not his failure to grasp a great opportunity, but the
comparatively venial excesses of his youth.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p><a name="ft1f" id="ft1f" href="#fa1f"><span class="fn">1</span></a>  This, at any rate, represents the general verdict of history.
It is interesting, however, to note that so liberal-minded and shrewd
a critic of men as King Leopold I. of the Belgians formed a different
estimate. In a letter of the 18th of November 1836 addressed to
Princess (afterwards Queen) Victoria he writes:&mdash;&ldquo;History will
state that Louis XVIII. was a most liberal monarch, reigning with
great mildness and justice to his end, but that his brother, from his
despotic and harsh disposition, upset all the other had done, and lost
the throne. Louis XVIII. was a clever, hard-hearted man, shackled
by no principle, very proud and false. Charles X. an honest man,
a kind friend, an honourable master, sincere in his opinions, and
inclined to do everything that is right. That teaches us what we
ought to believe in history as it is compiled according to ostensible
events and results known to the generality of people.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES I.<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (1288-1342), king of Hungary, the son of Charles
Martell of Naples, and Clemencia, daughter of the emperor
Rudolph, was known as Charles Robert previously to being
enthroned king of Hungary in 1309. He claimed the Hungarian
crown, as the grandson of Stephen V., under the banner of the
pope, and in August 1300 proceeded from Naples to Dalmatia
to make good his claim. He was crowned at Esztergom after
the death of the last Arpad, Andrew III. (1301), but was forced
the same year to surrender the crown to Wenceslaus II. of
Bohemia (1289-1306). His failure only made Pope Boniface
VIII. still more zealous on his behalf, and at the diet of Pressburg
(1304) his Magyar adherents induced him to attempt to recover
the crown of St Stephen from the Czechs. But in the meantime
(1305) Wenceslaus transferred his rights to Duke Otto of Bavaria,
who in his turn was taken prisoner by the Hungarian rebels.
Charles&rsquo;s prospects now improved, and he was enthroned at Buda
on the 15th of June 1309, though his installation was not regarded
as valid till he was crowned with the sacred crown (which
was at last recovered from the robber-barons) at Székesfehérvár
on the 27th of August 1310. For the next three years Charles
had to contend with rebellion after rebellion, and it was only
after his great victory over all the elements of rapine and disorder
at Rozgony (June 15, 1312) that he was really master in his
own land. His foreign policy aimed at the aggrandizement of
his family, but his plans were prudent as well as ambitious, and
Hungary benefited by them greatly. His most successful
achievement was the union with Poland for mutual defence
against the Habsburgs and the Czechs. This was accomplished
by the convention of Trencsén (1335), confirmed the same year
at the brilliant congress of Visegrád, where all the princes of
central Europe met to compose their differences and were
splendidly entertained during the months of October and
November. The immediate result of the congress was a combined
attack by the Magyars and Poles upon the emperor Louis and
his ally Albert of Austria, which resulted in favour of Charles
in 1337. Charles&rsquo;s desire to unite the kingdoms of Hungary
and Naples under the eldest son Louis was frustrated by Venice
and the pope, from fear lest Hungary might become the dominant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page923" id="page923"></a>923</span>
Adriatic power. He was, however, more than compensated for
this disappointment by his compact (1339) with his ally and
brother-in-law, Casimir of Poland, whereby it was agreed that
Louis should succeed to the Polish throne on the death of the
childless Casimir. For an account of the numerous important
reforms effected by Charles see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hungary</a></span>: <i>History</i>. A statesman
of the first rank, he not only raised Hungary once more to
the rank of a great power, but enriched and civilized her. In
character he was pious, courtly and valiant, popular alike with
the nobility and the middle classes, whose increasing welfare
he did so much to promote, and much beloved by the clergy.
His court was famous throughout Europe as a school of chivalry.</p>

<p>Charles was married thrice. His first wife was Maria, daughter
of Duke Casimir of Teschen, whom he wedded in 1306. On her
death in 1318 he married Beatrice, daughter of the emperor
Henry VII. On her decease two years later he gave his hand
to Elizabeth, daughter of Wladislaus Lokietek, king of Poland.
Five sons were the fruit of these marriages, of whom three,
Louis, Andrew and Stephen, survived him. He died on the 16th
of July 1342, and was laid beside the high altar at Székesfehérvár,
the ancient burial-place of the Arpads.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES I.<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (1226-1285), king of Naples and Sicily and
count of Anjou, was the seventh child of Louis VIII. of France
and Blanche of Castile. Louis died a few months after Charles&rsquo;s
birth and was succeeded by his son Louis IX. (St Louis), and on
the death in 1232 of the third son John, count of Anjou and
Maine, those fiefs were conferred on Charles. In 1246 he married
Beatrice, daughter and heiress of Raymond Bérenger V., the
last count of Provence, and after defeating James I. of Aragon
and other rivals with the help of his brother the French king,
he took possession of his new county. In 1248 he accompanied
Louis in the crusade to Egypt, but on the defeat of the Crusaders
he was taken prisoner with his brother. Shortly afterwards
he was ransomed, and returned to Provence in 1250. During
his absence several towns had asserted their independence; but
he succeeded in subduing them without much difficulty and
gradually suppressed their communal liberties. Charles&rsquo;s
ambition aimed at wider fields, and when Margaret, countess of
Flanders, asked help of the French court against the German
king William of Holland, by whom she had been defeated, he
gladly accepted her offer of the county of Hainaut in exchange
for his assistance (1253); this arrangement was, however,
rescinded by Louis of France, who returned from captivity in
1254, and Charles gave up Hainaut for an immense sum of
money. He extended his influence by the subjugation of Marseilles
in 1257, then one of the most important maritime cities
of the world, and two years later several communes of Piedmont
recognized Charles&rsquo;s suzerainty. In 1262 Pope Urban IV.
determined to destroy the power of the Hohenstaufen in Italy,
and offered the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, in consideration
of a yearly tribute, to Charles of Anjou, in opposition to Manfred,
the bastard son of the late emperor Frederick II. The next year
Charles succeeded in getting himself elected senator of Rome,
which gave him an advantage in dealing with the pope. After
long negotiations he accepted the Sicilian and Neapolitan
crowns, and in 1264 he sent a first expedition of Provençals to
Italy; he also collected a large army and navy in Provence
and France with the help of King Louis, and by an alliance with
the cities of Lombardy was able to send part of his force overland.
Pope Clement IV. confirmed the Sicilian agreement on conditions
even more favourable to Charles, who sailed in 1265, and conferred
on the expedition all the privileges of a crusade. After
narrowly escaping capture by Manfred&rsquo;s fleet he reached Rome
safely, where he was crowned king of the Two Sicilies. The land
army arrived soon afterwards, and on the 26th of February 1266
Charles encountered Manfred at Benevento, where after a hard-fought
battle Manfred was defeated and killed, and the whole
kingdom was soon in Charles&rsquo;s possession. Then Conradin,
Frederick&rsquo;s grandson and last legitimate descendant of the
Hohenstaufen, came into Italy, where he found many partisans
among the Ghibellines of Lombardy and Tuscany, and among
Manfred&rsquo;s former adherents in the south. He gathered a large
army consisting partly of Germans and Saracens, but was totally
defeated by Charles at Tagliacozzo (23rd of August 1268);
taken prisoner, he was tried as a rebel and executed at Naples.
Charles, in a spirit of the most vindictive cruelty, had large
numbers of Conradin&rsquo;s barons put to death and their estates
confiscated, and the whole population of several towns massacred.</p>

<p>He was now one of the most powerful sovereigns of Europe,
for besides ruling over Provence and Anjou and the kingdom
of the Two Sicilies, he was imperial vicar of Tuscany, lord of
many cities of Lombardy and Piedmont, and as the pope&rsquo;s
favourite practically arbiter of the papal states, especially during
the interregnum between the death of Clement IV. (1268) and
the election of Gregory X. (1272). But his ambition was by no
means satisfied, and he even aspired to the crown of the East
Roman empire. In 1272 he took part with Louis IX. in a
crusade to north Africa, where the French king died of fever,
and Charles, after defeating the soldan of Tunis, returned to
Sicily. The election of Rudolph of Habsburg as German king
after a long interregnum, and that of Nicholas III. to the Holy
See (1277), diminished Charles&rsquo;s power, for the new pope set
himself to compose the difference between Guelphs and Ghibellines
in the Italian cities, but at his death Charles secured the
election of his henchman Martin IV. (1281), who recommenced
persecuting the Ghibellines, excommunicated the Greek emperor,
Michael Palaeologus, proclaimed a crusade against the Greeks,
filled every appointment in the papal states with Charles&rsquo;s
vassals, and reappointed the Angevin king senator of Rome.
But the cruelty of the French rulers of Sicily drove the people
of the island to despair, and a Neapolitan nobleman, Giovanni da
Procida, organized the rebellion known as the Sicilian Vespers
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vespers, Sicilian</a></span>), in which the French in Sicily were all
massacred or expelled (1282). Charles determined to subjugate
the island and sailed with his fleet for Messina. The city held
out until Peter III. of Aragon, whose wife Constance was a
daughter of Manfred, arrived in Sicily, and a Sicilian-Catalan
fleet under the Calabrese admiral, Ruggiero di Lauria, completely
destroyed that of Charles. &ldquo;If thou art determined, O God,
to destroy me,&rdquo; the unhappy Angevin exclaimed, &ldquo;let my fall
be gradual!&rdquo; He was forced to abandon all attempts at
reconquest, but proposed to decide the question by single
combat between himself and Peter, to take place at Bordeaux
under English protection. The Aragonese accepted, but fearing
treachery, as the French army was in the neighbourhood, he
failed to appear on the appointed day. In the meanwhile
Ruggiero di Lauria appeared before Naples and destroyed
another Angevin fleet commanded by Charles&rsquo;s son, who was
taken prisoner (May 1284). Charles came to Naples with a new
fleet from Provence, and was preparing to invade Sicily again,
when he contracted a fever and died at Foggia on the 7th of
January 1285. He was undoubtedly an extremely able soldier
and a skilful statesman, and much of his legislation shows a
real political sense; but his inordinate ambition, his oppressive
methods of government and taxation, and his cruelty created
enemies on all sides, and led to the collapse of the edifice of
dominion which he had raised.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1250-1309), king of Naples and Sicily, son of
Charles I., had been captured by Ruggiero di Lauria in the naval
battle at Naples in 1284, and when his father died he was still a
prisoner in the hands of Peter of Aragon. In 1288 King Edward I.
of England had mediated to make peace, and Charles was
liberated on the understanding that he was to retain Naples
alone, Sicily being left to the Aragonese; Charles was also to
induce his cousin Charles of Valois to renounce for twenty
thousand pounds of silver the kingdom of Aragon which had
been given to him by Pope Martin IV. to punish Peter for having
invaded Sicily, but which the Valois had never effectively
occupied. The Angevin king was thereupon set free, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page924" id="page924"></a>924</span>
three of his sons and sixty Provençal nobles as hostages, promising
to pay 30,000 marks and to return a prisoner if the conditions
were not fulfilled within three years. He went to Rieti, where
the new pope Nicholas IV. immediately absolved him from all
the conditions he had sworn to observe, crowned him king of
the Two Sicilies (1289), and excommunicated Alphonso, while
Charles of Valois, in alliance with Castile, prepared to take
possession of Aragon. Alphonso III, the Aragonese king, being
hard pressed, had to promise to withdraw the troops he had
sent to help his brother James in Sicily, to renounce all rights
over the island, and pay a tribute to the Holy See. But Alphonso
died childless in 1291 before the treaty could be carried out, and
James took possession of Aragon, leaving the government of
Sicily to the third brother Frederick. The new pope Boniface
VIII., elected in 1294 at Naples under the auspices of King
Charles, mediated between the latter and James, and a most
dishonourable treaty was signed: James was to marry Charles&rsquo;s
daughter Bianca and was promised the investiture by the pope
of Sardinia and Corsica, while he was to leave the Angevin a free
hand in Sicily and even to assist him if the Sicilians resisted. An
attempt was made to bribe Frederick into consenting to this
arrangement, but being backed up by his people he refused, and
was afterwards crowned king of Sicily. The war was fought with
great fury on land and sea, but Charles, although aided by the
pope, by Charles of Valois, and by James II. of Aragon, was
unable to conquer the island, and his son the prince of Taranto
was taken prisoner at the battle of La Falconara in 1299.    Peace
was at last made in 1302 at Caltabellotta, Charles II. giving up
all rights to Sicily and agreeing to the marriage of his daughter
Leonora to King Frederick; the treaty was ratified by the
pope in 1303. Charles spent his last years quietly in Naples,
which city he improved and embellished. He died in August
1309, and was succeeded by his son Robert.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;A. de Saint-Priest, <i>Histoire de la conquête de
Naples par Charles d&rsquo;Anjou</i> (4 vols., Paris, 1847-1849), is still of use
for the documents from the archives of Barcelona, but it needs to
be collated with more recent works; S. de Sismondi, in vol. ii. of
his <i>Histoire des republiques italiennes</i> (Brussels, 1838), gives a good
general sketch of the reigns of Charles I. and II., but is occasionally
inaccurate as to details; the best authority on the early life of
Charles I. is R. Sternfeld, <i>Karl von Anjou als Graf von Provence
</i> (Berlin, 1888); Charles&rsquo;s connexion with north Italy is dealt with in
Merkel&rsquo;s <i>La Dominazione di Carlo d&rsquo;Angio in Piemonte e in Lombardia
</i> (Turin, 1891), while the R. Deputazione di Storia Patria Toscana
has recently published a <i>Codice diplomatico delle relazioni di Carlo
d&rsquo;Angio con la Toscana</i>; the contents of the Angevin archives at
Naples have been published by Durrien, <i>Archives angevines de Naples</i>
(Toulouse, 1866-1867). M. Amari&rsquo;s <i>La Guerra del Vespro Siciliano</i>
(8th ed., Florence, 1876) is a valuable history, but the author is too
bitterly prejudiced against the French to be quite impartial; his
work should be compared with L. Cadier&rsquo;s <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;administration
du royaume de Sicile sous Charles I et Charles II d&rsquo;Anjou</i> (Paris,
1891, <i>Bibl. des écoles françaises d&rsquo;Athenes et de Rome,</i> fasc. 59), which
contains many documents, and tends somewhat to rehabilitate the
Angevin rule.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (1332-1387), called <span class="sc">The Bad</span>, king of Navarre
and count of Evreux, was a son of Jeanne II., queen of Navarre,
by her marriage with Philip, count of Evreux (d. 1343). Having
become king of Navarre on Jeanne&rsquo;s death in 1349, he suppressed
a rising at Pampeluna with much cruelty, and by this and
similar actions thoroughly earned his surname of &ldquo;The Bad.&rdquo; In
1352 he married Jeanne (d. 1393), a daughter of John II., king of
France, a union which made his relationship to the French crown
still more complicated. Through his mother he was a grandson of
Louis X. and through his father a great-grandson of Philip III.,
having thus a better claim to the throne of France than Edward
III. of England; and, moreover, he held lands under the suzerainty
of the French king, whose son-in-law he now became. Charles
was a man of great ability, possessing popular manners and considerable
eloquence, but he was singularly unscrupulous, a quality
which was revealed during the years in which he played an important
part in the internal affairs of France. Trouble soon arose
between King John and his son-in-law. The promised dowry had
not been paid, and the county of Angoulême, which had formerly
belonged to Jeanne of Navarre, was now in the possession of the
French king&rsquo;s favourite, the constable Charles la Cerda. In
January 1354 the constable was assassinated by order of Charles,
and preparations for war were begun. The king of Navarre, who
defended this deed, had, however, many friends in France and was
in communication with Edward III.; and consequently John was
forced to make a treaty at Mantes and to compensate him for the
loss of Angoulême by a large grant of lands, chiefly in Normandy.
This peace did not last long, and in 1355 John was compelled to
confirm the treaty of Mantes. Returning to Normandy, Charles
was partly responsible for some unrest in the duchy, and in April
1356 he was treacherously seized by the French king at Rouen,
remaining in captivity until November 1357, when John, after
his defeat at Poitiers, was a prisoner in England. Charles was
regarded with much favour in France, and the states-general
demanded his release, which, however, was effected by a surprise.
Owing to his popularity he was considered by Étienne Marcel
and his party as a suitable rival to the dauphin, afterwards King
Charles V., and on entering Paris he was well received and
delivered an eloquent harangue to the Parisians. Subsequently
peace was made with the dauphin, who promised to restore to
Charles his confiscated estates. This peace was not enduring, and
as his lands were not given back Charles had some ground for
complaint. War again broke out, quickly followed by a new
treaty, after which the king of Navarre took part in suppressing
the peasant rising known as the <i>Jacquerie</i>. Answering the entreaties
of Marcel he returned to Paris on June 1358, and became
captain-general of the city, which was soon besieged by the
dauphin. This position, however, did not prevent him from
negotiating both with the dauphin and with the English; terms
were soon arranged with the former, and Charles, having lost
much of his popularity, left Paris just before the murder of
Marcel in July 1358. He continued his alternate policy of war
and peace, meanwhile adding if possible by his depredations to
the misery of France, until the conclusion of the treaty of
Brétigny in May 1360 deprived him of the alliance of the English,
and compelled him to make peace with King John in the following
October. A new cause of trouble arose when the duchy of
Burgundy was left without a ruler in November 1361, and was
claimed by Charles; but, lacking both allies and money, he was
unable to prevent the French king from seizing Burgundy, while
he himself returned to Navarre.</p>

<p>In his own kingdom Charles took some steps to reform the
financial and judicial administration and so to increase his
revenue; but he was soon occupied once more with foreign
entanglements, and in July 1362, in alliance with Peter the Cruel,
king of Castile, he invaded Aragon, deserting his new ally soon
afterwards for Peter IV., king of Aragon. Meanwhile the war
with the dauphin had been renewed. Still hankering after
Burgundy, Charles saw his French estates again seized; but after
some desultory warfare, chiefly in Normandy, peace was made
in March 1365, and he returned to his work of interference in the
politics of the Spanish kingdoms. In turn he made treaties with
the kings of Castile and Aragon, who were at war with each
other; promising to assist Peter the Cruel to regain his throne,
from which he had been driven in 1366 by his half-brother Henry
of Trastamara, and then assuring Henry and his ally Peter of
Aragon that he would aid them to retain Castile. He continued
this treacherous policy when Edward the Black Prince advanced
to succour Peter the Cruel; then signed a treaty with Edward
of England, and then in 1371 allied himself with Charles V. of
France. His next important move was to offer his assistance to
Richard II. of England for an attack upon France. About this
time serious charges were brought against him. Accused of
attempting to poison the king of France and other prominent
persons, and of other crimes, his French estates were seized by
order of Charles V., and soon afterwards Navarre was invaded by
the Castilians. Won over by the surrender of Cherbourg in July
1378, the English under John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, came
to his aid; but a heavy price had to be paid for the neutrality
of the king of Castile. After the death of Charles V. in 1380, the
king of Navarre did not interfere in the internal affairs of France,
although he endeavoured vainly again to obtain aid from Richard
II., and to regain Cherbourg. His lands in France were handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page925" id="page925"></a>925</span>
over to his eldest son Charles, who governed them with the consent
of the new king Charles VI. Charles died on the 1st of January
1387, and many stories are current regarding the manner of his
death. Froissart relates that he was burned to death through his
bedclothes catching fire; Secousse says that he died in peace
with many signs of contrition; another story says he died of
leprosy; and a popular legend tells how he expired by a divine
judgment through the burning of the clothes steeped in sulphur
and spirits in which he had been wrapped as a cure for a loathsome
disease caused by his debauchery. He had three sons and
four daughters, and was succeeded by his eldest son Charles; one
of his daughters, Jeanne, became the wife of Henry IV. of
England.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES III.<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (1361-1425), called <span class="sc">The Noble</span>, king of Navarre
and count of Evreux, was the eldest son of Charles II. the Bad,
king of Navarre, by his marriage with Jeanne, daughter of John
II., king of France, and was married in 1375 to Leonora (d. 1415),
daughter of Henry II., king of Castile. Having passed much of
his early life in France, he became king of Navarre on the death of
Charles II. in January 1387, and his reign was a period of peace
and order, thus contrasting sharply with the long and calamitous
reign of his father. In 1393 he regained Cherbourg, which had
been handed over by Charles II. to Richard II. of England, and
in 1403 he came to an arrangement with the representatives of
Charles VI. of France concerning the extensive lands which he
claimed in that country. Cherbourg was given to the French
king; certain exchanges of land were made; and in the following
year Charles III. surrendered the county of Evreux, and was
created duke of Nemours and made a peer of France. After this
his only interference in the internal affairs of France was when he
sought to make peace between the rival factions in that country.
Charles sought to improve the condition of Navarre by making
canals and rendering the rivers navigable, and in other ways.
He died at Olite on the 8th of September 1425 and was buried at
Pampeluna. After the death of his two sons in 1402 the king
decreed that his kingdom should pass to his daughter Blanche
(d. 1441), who took for her second husband John, afterwards
John II., king of Aragon; and the cortes of Navarre swore to
recognize Charles (<i>q.v.</i>), prince of Viana, her son by this marriage,
as king after his mother&rsquo;s death.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Karl Eitel Zephyrin Ludwig</span>; in Rum.
<span class="sc">Carol</span>), king of Rumania (1839-&emsp;&emsp;), second son of Prince Karl
Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, was born on the 20th of
April 1839. He was educated at Dresden (1850-1856), and
passed through his university course at Bonn. Entering the
Prussian army in 1857, he won considerable distinction in the
Danish war of 1864, and received instruction in strategy from
General von Moltke. He afterwards travelled in France, Italy,
Spain and Algeria. He was a captain in the 2nd regiment of
Prussian Dragoon Guards when he was elected <i>hospodar</i> or
prince of Rumania on the 20th of April 1866, after the compulsory
abdication of Prince Alexander John Cuza. Regarded at first
with distrust by Turkey, Russia and Austria, he succeeded in
gaining general recognition in six months; but he had to contend
for ten years with fierce party struggles between the
Conservatives and the Liberals.</p>

<p>During this period, however, Charles displayed great tact in
his dealings with both parties, and kept his country in the path
of administrative and economic reform, organizing the army,
developing the railways, and establishing commercial relations
with foreign powers. The sympathy of Rumania with France
in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and the consequent interruption
of certain commercial undertakings, led to a hostile
movement against Prince Charles, which, being fostered by
Russia, made him resolve to abdicate; and it was with difficulty
that he was persuaded to remain. In the Russo-Turkish War
of 1877-78 he joined the Russians before Plevna (<i>q.v.</i>), and
being placed in command of the combined Russian and
Rumanian forces, forced Osman Pasha to surrender. As a consequence
of the prince&rsquo;s vigorous action the independence of
Rumania, which had been proclaimed in May 1877, was confirmed
by various treaties in 1878, and recognized by Great
Britain, France and Germany in 1880. On the 26th of March
1881 he was proclaimed king of Rumania, and, with his consort,
was crowned on the 22nd of May following. From that time he
pursued a successful career in home and foreign policy, and
greatly improved the financial and military position of his
country; while his appreciation of the fine arts was shown by
his formation of an important collection of paintings of all
schools in his palaces at Sinaïa and Bucharest. For a detailed
account of his reign, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rumania</a></span>. On the 1st of November
1869 he married Princess Elizabeth (<i>q.v.</i>), a daughter of Prince
Hermann of Wied, widely known under her literary name of
&ldquo;Carmen Sylva.&rdquo; As the only child of the marriage, a daughter,
died in 1874, the succession was finally settled upon the king&rsquo;s
nephew, Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who
was created prince of Rumania on the 18th of March 1889,
and married, on the 10th of January 1893, Princess Marie,
daughter of Alfred, duke of Saxe-Coburg, their children being

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1661-1700), king of Spain, known among
Spanish kings as &ldquo;The Desired&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bewitched,&rdquo; was the
son of Philip IV. by his second marriage with Maria, daughter
of the emperor Ferdinand III., his niece. He was born on the
11th of November 1661, and was the only surviving son of his
father&rsquo;s two marriages&mdash;a child of old age and disease, in
whom the constant intermarriages of the Habsburgs had developed
the family type to deformity. His birth was greeted
with joy by the Spaniards, who feared the dispute as to the
succession which must have ensued if Philip IV. left no male
issue. The boy was so feeble that till the age of five or six he
was fed only from the breast of a nurse. For years afterwards
it was not thought safe to allow him to walk. That he might not
be overtaxed he was left entirely uneducated, and his indolence
was indulged to such an extent that he was not even expected
to be clean. When his brother, the younger Don John of Austria,
a natural son of Philip IV., obtained power by exiling the queen
mother from court he insisted that at least the king&rsquo;s hair should
be combed. Charles made the malicious remark that nothing
was safe from Don John&mdash;not even vermin. The king was then
fifteen, and, according to Spanish law, of age. But he never
became a man in body or mind. The personages who ruled in
his name arranged a marriage for him with Maria Louisa of
Orleans. The French princess, a lively young woman of no
sense, died in the stifling atmosphere of the Spanish court, and
from the attendance of Spanish doctors. Again his advisers
arranged a marriage with Maria Ana of Neuburg. The Bavarian
wife stood the strain and survived him. Both marriages were
merely political&mdash;the first a victory for the French, and the
second for the Austrian party. France and Austria were alike
preparing for the day when the Spanish succession would have
to be fought for. The king was a mere puppet in the hands of
each alternately. By natural instinct he hated the French, but
there was no room in his nearly imbecile mind for more than
childish superstition, insane pride of birth, and an interest in
court etiquette. The only touch of manhood was a taste for
shooting which he occasionally indulged in the preserves of the
Escorial. In his later days he suffered much pain, and was driven
wild by the conflict between his wish to transmit his inheritance
to &ldquo;the illustrious house of Austria,&rdquo; his own kin, and the belief
instilled into him by the partisans of the French claimant that
only the power of Louis XIV. could avert the dismemberment
of the empire. A silly fanatic made the discovery that the king
was bewitched, and his confessor Froilan Diaz supported the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page926" id="page926"></a>926</span>
belief. The king was exorcised, and the exorcists of the kingdom
were called upon to put stringent questions to the devils
they cast out. The Inquisition interfered, and the dying king
was driven mad among them. Very near his end he had the
lugubrious curiosity to cause the coffins of his embalmed ancestors
to be opened at the Escorial. The sight of the body of
his first wife, at whom he also insisted on looking, provoked a
passion of tears and despair. Under severe pressure from the
cardinal archbishop of Toledo, Portocarrero, he finally made a
will in favour of Philip, duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV.,
and died on the 1st of November 1700, after a lifetime of senile
decay.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES III.<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (1716-1788), king of Spain, born on the 20th
January 1716, was the first son of the second marriage of Philip
V. with Elizabeth Farnese of Parma. It was his good fortune
to be sent to rule as duke of Parma by right of his mother at the
age of sixteen, and thus came under more intelligent influence
than he could have found in Spain. In 1734 he made himself
master of Naples and Sicily by arms. Charles had, however, no
military tastes, seldom wore uniform, and could with difficulty
be persuaded to witness a review. The peremptory action of
the British admiral commanding in the Mediterranean at the
approach of the War of the Austrian Succession, who forced
him to promise to observe neutrality under a threat to bombard
Naples, made a deep impression on his mind. It gave him a
feeling of hostility to England which in after-times influenced
his policy.</p>

<p>As king of the Two Sicilies Charles began there the work
of internal reform which he afterwards continued in Spain.
Foreign ministers who dealt with him agreed that he had no great
natural ability, but he was honestly desirous to do his duty as
king, and he showed good judgment in his choice of ministers.
The chief minister in Naples, Tanucci, had a considerable influence
over him. On the death of his half-brother Ferdinand VI.
he became king of Spain, and resigned the Two Sicilies to his
third son Ferdinand. As king of Spain his foreign policy was
disastrous. His strong family feeling and his detestation of
England, which was unchecked after the death of his wife, Maria
Amelia, daughter of Frederick Augustus II. of Saxony, led him
into the Family Compact with France. Spain was entangled in
the close of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, to her great loss. In 1770 he
almost ran into another war over the barren Falkland Islands.
In 1779 he was, somewhat reluctantly, led to join France and
the American insurgents against England, though he well knew
that the independence of the English colonies must have a
ruinous influence on his own American dominions. For his army
he did practically nothing, and for his fleet very little except
build fine ships without taking measures to train officers and
men.</p>

<p>But his internal government was on the whole beneficial to the
country. He began by compelling the people of Madrid to give
up emptying their slops out of the windows, and when they
objected he said they were like children who cried when their
faces were washed. In 1766 his attempt to force the Madrileños
to adopt the French dress led to a riot during which he did not
display much personal courage. For a long time after it he
remained at Aranjuez, leaving the government in the hands
of his minister Aranda. All his reforms were not of this formal
kind. Charles was a thorough despot of the benevolent order,
and had been deeply offended by the real or suspected share of
the Jesuits in the riot of 1766. He therefore consented to the
expulsion of the order, and was then the main advocate for its
suppression. His quarrel with the Jesuits, and the recollection
of some disputes with the pope he had had when king of Naples,
turned him towards a general policy of restriction of the overgrown
power of the church. The number of the idle clergy, and
more particularly of the monastic orders, was reduced, and the
Inquisition, though not abolished, was rendered torpid. In the
meantime much antiquated legislation which tended to restrict
trade and industry was abolished; roads, canals and drainage
works were carried out. Many of his paternal ventures led to
little more than waste of money, or the creation of hotbeds of
jobbery. Yet on the whole the country prospered. The result
was largely due to the king, who even when he was ill-advised
did at least work steadily at his task of government. His
example was not without effect on some at least of the nobles.
In his domestic life King Charles was regular, and was a considerate
master, though he had a somewhat caustic tongue
and took a rather cynical view of mankind. He was passionately
fond of hunting. During his later years he had some trouble
with his eldest son and his daughter-in-law. If Charles had lived
to see the beginning of the French Revolution he would probably
have been frightened into reaction. As he died on the 14th of
December 1788 he left the reputation of a philanthropic and
&ldquo;philosophic&rdquo; king. In spite of his hostility to the Jesuits, his
dislike of friars in general, and his jealousy of the Inquisition,
he was a very sincere Roman Catholic, and showed much zeal in
endeavouring to persuade the pope to proclaim the Immaculate
Conception as a dogma necessary to salvation.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IV.<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span> (1748-1819), king of Spain, second son of Charles
III. and his wife Maria Amelia of Saxony, was born at Portici
on the 11th of November 1748, while his father was king of the
Two Sicilies. The elder brother was set aside as imbecile and
epileptic. Charles had inherited a great frame and immense
physical strength from the Saxon line of his mother. When
young he was fond of wrestling with the strongest countrymen
he could find. In character he was not malignant, but he was
intellectually torpid, and of a credulity which almost passes
belief. His wife, Maria Luisa of Parma, his first cousin, a
thoroughly coarse and vicious woman, ruled him completely,
though he was capable of obstinacy at times. During his father&rsquo;s
lifetime he was led by her into court intrigues which aimed
at driving the king&rsquo;s favourite minister, Floridablanca, from
office, and replacing him by Aranda, the chief of the &ldquo;Aragonese&rdquo;
party. After he succeeded to the throne in 1788 his one serious
occupation was hunting. Affairs were left to be directed by his
wife and her lover Godoy (<i>q.v.</i>). For Godoy the king had an
unaffected liking, and the lifelong favour he showed him is almost
pathetic. When terrified by the French Revolution he turned
to the Inquisition to help him against the party which would have
carried the reforming policy of Charles III. much further. But
he was too slothful to have more than a passive part in the
direction of his own government. He simply obeyed the impulse
given him by the queen and Godoy. If he ever knew his wife&rsquo;s
real character he thought it more consistent with his dignity
to shut his eyes. For he had a profound belief in his divine right
and the sanctity of his person. If he understood that his kingdom
was treated as a mere dependence by France, he also thought
it due to his &ldquo;face&rdquo; to make believe that he was a powerful
monarch. Royalty never wore a more silly aspect than in the
person of Charles IV., and it is highly credible that he never
knew what his wife was, or what was the position of his kingdom.
When he was told that his son Ferdinand was appealing to the
emperor Napoleon against Godoy, he took the side of the favourite.
When the populace rose at Aranjuez in 1808 he abdicated to save
the minister. He took refuge in France, and when he and
Ferdinand were both prisoners of Napoleon&rsquo;s, he was with
difficulty restrained from assaulting his son. Then he abdicated
in favour of Napoleon, handing over his people like a herd of
cattle. He accepted a pension from the French emperor and
spent the rest of his life between his wife and Godoy. He died
at Rome on the 20th of January 1819, probably without having
once suspected that he had done anything unbecoming a king
by divine right and a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IX.<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> (1550-1611), king of Sweden, was the youngest
son of Gustavus Vasa and Margareto Lejonhufrud. By his
father&rsquo;s will he got, by way of appanage, the duchy of Södermanland,
which included the provinces of Neriké and Vermland;
but he did not come into actual possession of them till after the
fall of Eric XIV. (1569). In 1568 he was the real leader of the
rebellion against Eric, but took no part in the designs of his
brother John against the unhappy king after his deposition.
Indeed, Charles&rsquo;s relations with John III. were always more or
less strained. He had no sympathy with John&rsquo;s high-church
tendencies on the one hand, and he sturdily resisted all the king&rsquo;s
endeavours to restrict his authority as duke of Södermanland
(Sudermania) on the other. The nobility and the majority of
the <i>Riksdag</i> supported John, however, in his endeavours to unify
the realm, and Charles had consequently (1587) to resign his
pretensions to autonomy within his duchy; but, fanatical
Calvinist as he was, on the religious question he was immovable.
The matter came to a crisis on the death of John III. (1592).
The heir to the throne was John&rsquo;s eldest son, Sigismund, already
king of Poland and a devoted Catholic. The fear lest Sigismund
might re-catholicize the land alarmed the Protestant majority
in Sweden, and Charles came forward as their champion, and also
as the defender of the Vasa dynasty against foreign interference.
It was due entirely to him that Sigismund was forced to confirm
the resolutions of the council of Upsala, thereby recognizing
the fact that Sweden was essentially a Protestant state (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>: <i>History</i>). In the ensuing years Charles&rsquo;s task was
extraordinarily difficult. He had steadily to oppose Sigismund&rsquo;s
reactionary tendencies; he had also to curb the nobility, which
he did with cruel rigour. Necessity compelled him to work
rather with the people than the gentry; hence it was that the
<i>Riksdag</i> assumed under his government a power and an importance
which it had never possessed before. In 1595 the
<i>Riksdag</i> of Söderköping elected Charles regent, and his attempt
to force Klas Flemming, governor of Finland, to submit to his
authority, rather than to that of the king, provoked a civil war.
Technically Charles was, without doubt, guilty of high treason,
and the considerable minority of all classes which adhered to
Sigismund on his landing in Sweden in 1598 indisputably behaved
like loyal subjects. But Sigismund was both an alien and a
heretic to the majority of the Swedish nation, and his formal
deposition by the <i>Riksdag</i> in 1599 was, in effect, a natural vindication
and legitimation of Charles&rsquo;s position. Finally, the diet of
Linköping (Feb. 24, 1600) declared that Sigismund and his
posterity had forfeited the Swedish throne, and, passing over
duke John, the second son of John III., a youth of ten, recognized
duke Charles as their sovereign under the title of Charles IX.</p>

<p>Charles&rsquo;s short reign was an uninterrupted warfare. The hostility
of Poland and the break up of Russia involved him in two
overseas contests for the possession of Livonia and Ingria,
while his pretensions to Lapland brought upon him a war with
Denmark in the last year of his reign. In all these struggles
he was more or less unsuccessful, owing partly to the fact that
he had to do with superior generals (<i>e.g.</i> Chodkiewicz and
Christian IV.) and partly to sheer ill-luck. Compared with his
foreign policy, the domestic policy of Charles IX. was comparatively
unimportant. It aimed at confirming and supplementing
what had already been done during his regency. Not
till the 6th of March 1604, after Duke John had formally
renounced his rights to the throne, did Charles IX. begin to style
himself king. The first deed in which the title appears is dated
the 20th of March 1604; but he was not crowned till the 15th of
March 1607. Four and a half years later Charles IX. died at
Nyköping (Oct. 30, 1611). As a ruler he is the link between
his great father and his still greater son. He consolidated the
work of Gustavus Vasa, the creation of a great Protestant state:
he prepared the way for the erection of the Protestant empire
of Gustavus Adolphus. Swedish historians have been excusably
indulgent to the father of their greatest ruler. Indisputably
Charles was cruel, ungenerous and vindictive; yet he seems,
at all hazards, strenuously to have endeavoured to do his duty
during a period of political and religious transition, and, despite
his violence and brutality, possessed many of the qualities of a
wise and courageous statesman. By his first wife Marie, daughter
of the elector palatine Louis VI., he had six children, of whom
only one daughter, Catherine, survived; by his second wife,
Christina, daughter of Adolphus, duke of Holstein-Gottorp,
he had five children, including Gustavus Adolphus and Charles
Philip, duke of Finland.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES X.<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Charles Gustavus</span>] (1622-1660), king of
Sweden, son of John Casimir, count palatine of Zweibrücken,
and Catherine, sister of Gustavus Adolphus, was born at Nyköping
Castle on the 8th of November 1622. He learnt the art of
war under the great Lennart Torstensson, being present at the
second battle of Breitenfeld and at Jankowitz. From 1646
to 1648 he frequented the Swedish court. It was supposed that
he would marry the queen regnant, Christina, but her unsurmountable
objection to wedlock put an end to these anticipations,
and to compensate her cousin for a broken half-promise she
declared him (1649) her successor, despite the opposition of the
senate headed by the venerable Axel Oxenstjerna. In 1648 he
was appointed generalissimo of the Swedish forces in Germany.
The conclusion of the treaties of Westphalia prevented him from
winning the military laurels he so ardently desired, but as the
Swedish plenipotentiary at the executive congress of Nuremberg,
he had unrivalled opportunities of learning diplomacy, in which
science he speedily became a past-master. As the recognized
heir to the throne, his position on his return to Sweden was not
without danger, for the growing discontent with the queen
turned the eyes of thousands to him as a possible deliverer.
He therefore withdrew to the isle of Öland till the abdication of
Christina (June 5, 1654) called him to the throne.</p>

<p>The beginning of his reign was devoted to the healing of
domestic discords, and the rallying of all the forces of the nation
round his standard for a new policy of conquest. He contracted
a political marriage (Oct. 24, 1654) with Hedwig Leonora, the
daughter of Frederick III., duke of Holstein-Gottorp, by way of
securing a future ally against Denmark. The two great pressing
national questions, war and the restitution of the alienated crown
lands, were duly considered at the <i>Riksdag</i> which assembled
at Stockholm in March 1655. The war question was decided in
three days by a secret committee presided over by the king, who
easily persuaded the delegates that a war with Poland was
necessary and might prove very advantageous; but the consideration
of the question of the subsidies due to the crown
for military purposes was postponed to the following <i>Riksdag</i>
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>: <i>History</i>). On the 10th of July Charles quitted
Sweden to engage in his Polish adventure. By the time war was
declared he had at his disposal 50,000 men and 50 warships.
Hostilities had already begun with the occupation of Dünaburg
(Dvinsk) in Polish Livonia by the Swedes (July 1, 1655), and
the Polish army encamped among the marshes of the Netze
concluded a convention (July 25) whereby the palatinates of
Posen and Kalisz placed themselves under the protection of the
Swedish king. Thereupon the Swedes entered Warsaw without
opposition and occupied the whole of Great Poland. The Polish
king, John Casimir, fled to Silesia. Meanwhile Charles pressed
on towards Cracow, which was captured after a two months&rsquo;
siege. The fall of Cracow extinguished the last hope of the
boldest Pole; but before the end of the year an extraordinary
reaction began in Poland itself. On the 18th of October the
Swedes invested the fortress-monastery of Czenstochowa, but
the place was heroically defended; and after a seventy days&rsquo;
siege the besiegers were compelled to retire with great loss.</p>

<p>This astounding success elicited an outburst of popular
enthusiasm which gave the war a national and religious character.
The tactlessness of Charles, the rapacity of his generals, the
barbarity of his mercenaries, his refusal to legalize his position
by summoning the Polish diet, his negotiations for the partition
of the very state he affected to befriend, awoke the long slumbering
public spirit of the country. In the beginning of 1656 John
Casimir returned from exile and the Polish army was reorganized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page928" id="page928"></a>928</span>
and increased. By this time Charles had discovered that it
was easier to defeat the Poles than to conquer Poland. His
chief object, the conquest of Prussia, was still unaccomplished,
and a new foe arose in the elector of Brandenburg, alarmed by
the ambition of the Swedish king. Charles forced the elector,
indeed, at the point of the sword to become his ally and
vassal (treaty of Königsberg, Jan. 17, 1656); but the Polish
national rising now imperatively demanded his presence in the
south. For weeks he scoured the interminable snow-covered
plains of Poland in pursuit of the Polish guerillas, penetrating
as far south as Jaroslau in Galicia, by which time he had lost
two-thirds of his 15,000 men with no apparent result. His
retreat from Jaroslau to Warsaw, with the fragments of his host,
amidst three converging armies, in a marshy forest region,
intersected in every direction by well-guarded rivers, was one
of his most brilliant achievements. But his necessities were
overwhelming. On the 21st of June Warsaw was retaken by
the Poles, and four days later Charles was obliged to purchase
the assistance of Frederick William by the treaty of Marienburg.
On July 18-20 the combined Swedes and Brandenburgers,
18,000 strong, after a three days&rsquo; battle, defeated John Casimir&rsquo;s
army of 100,000 at Warsaw and reoccupied the Polish capital;
but this brilliant feat of arms was altogether useless, and when
the suspicious attitude of Frederick William compelled the
Swedish king at last to open negotiations with the Poles, they
refused the terms offered, the war was resumed, and Charles
concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with the elector
of Brandenburg (treaty of Labiau, Nov. 20) whereby it was
agreed that Frederick William and his heirs should henceforth
possess the full sovereignty of East Prussia.</p>

<p>This was an essential modification of Charles&rsquo;s Baltic policy;
but the alliance of the elector had now become indispensable
on almost any terms. So serious, indeed, were the difficulties
of Charles X. in Poland that it was with extreme satisfaction
that he received the tidings of the Danish declaration of war
(June 1, 1657). The hostile action of Denmark enabled him
honourably to emerge from the inglorious Polish imbroglio, and
he was certain of the zealous support of his own people. He had
learnt from Torstensson that Denmark was most vulnerable
if attacked from the south, and, imitating the strategy of his
master, he fell upon her with a velocity which paralysed resistance.
At the end of June 1657, at the head of 8000 seasoned
veterans, he broke up from Bromberg in Prussia and reached
the borders of Holstein on the 18th of July. The Danish army
at once dispersed and the duchy of Bremen was recovered by
the Swedes, who in the early autumn swarmed over Jutland and
firmly established themselves in the duchies. But the fortress
of Fredriksodde (Fredericia) held Charles&rsquo;s little army at bay
from mid-August to mid-October, while the fleet of Denmark,
after a stubborn two days&rsquo; battle, compelled the Swedish fleet
to abandon its projected attack on the Danish islands. The
position of the Swedish king had now become critical. In July
an offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between Denmark
and Poland. Still more ominously, the elector of Brandenburg,
perceiving Sweden to be in difficulties, joined the league
against her and compelled Charles to accept the proffered
mediation of Cromwell and Mazarin. The negotiations foundered,
however, upon the refusal of Sweden to refer the points in
dispute to a general peace-congress, and Charles was still further
encouraged by the capture of Fredriksodde (Oct. 23-24),
whereupon he began to make preparations for conveying his
troops over to Fünen in transport vessels. But soon another
and cheaper expedient presented itself. In the middle of
December 1657 began the great frost which was to be so fatal
to Denmark. In a few weeks the cold had grown so intense that
even the freezing of an arm of the sea with so rapid a current as
the Little Belt became a conceivable possibility; and henceforth
meteorological observations formed an essential part of
the strategy of the Swedes. On the 28th of January 1658,
Charles X. arrived at Haderslev (Hadersleben) in South Jutland,
when it was estimated that in a couple of days the ice of the
Little Belt would be firm enough to bear even the passage of a
mail-clad host. The cold during the night of the 29th of January
was most severe; and early in the morning of the 30th the
Swedish king gave the order to start, the horsemen dismounting
where the ice was weakest, and cautiously leading their horses
as far apart as possible, when they swung into their saddles
again, closed their ranks and made a dash for the shore. The
Danish troops lining the opposite coast were quickly overpowered,
and the whole of Fünen was won with the loss of only
two companies of cavalry, which disappeared under the ice
while fighting with the Danish left wing. Pursuing his irresistible
march, Charles X., with his eyes fixed steadily on Copenhagen,
resolved to cross the frozen Great Belt also. After some hesitation,
he accepted the advice of his chief engineer officer Eric
Dahlberg, who acted as pioneer throughout and chose the more
circuitous route from Svendborg, by the islands of Langeland,
Laaland and Falster, in preference to the direct route from
Nyborg to Korsör, which would have been across a broad,
almost uninterrupted expanse of ice. Yet this second adventure
was not embarked upon without much anxious consideration.
A council of war, which met at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning to
consider the practicability of Dahlberg&rsquo;s proposal, at once
dismissed it as criminally hazardous. Even the king wavered
for an instant; but, Dahlberg persisting in his opinion, Charles
overruled the objections of the commanders. On the night of
the 5th of February the transit began, the cavalry leading the
way through the snow-covered ice, which quickly thawed
beneath the horses&rsquo; hoofs so that the infantry which followed
after had to wade through half an ell of sludge, fearing every
moment lest the rotting ice should break beneath their feet.
At three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Dahlberg leading the way,
the army reached Grimsted in Laaland without losing a man
On the 8th of February Charles reached Falster. On the 11th
he stood safely on the soil of Sjaelland (Zealand). Not without
reason did the medal struck to commemorate &ldquo;the glorious
transit of the Baltic Sea&rdquo; bear the haughty inscription: <i>Natura
hoc debuit uni.</i> An exploit unique in history had been achieved.
The crushing effect of this unheard-of achievement on the
Danish government found expression in the treaties of Taastrup
(Feb. 18) and Roskilde (Feb. 26, 1658), whereby Denmark
sacrificed nearly half her territory to save the rest (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Denmark</a></span>: <i>History</i>). But even this was not enough for the
conqueror. Military ambition and greed of conquest moved
Charles X. to what, divested of all its pomp and circumstance,
was an outrageous act of political brigandage. At a council held
at Gottorp (July 7), Charles X. resolved to wipe from the map
of Europe an inconvenient rival, and without any warning, in
defiance of all international equity, let loose his veterans upon
Denmark a second time. For the details of this second struggle,
with the concomitant diplomatic intervention of the western
powers, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Denmark</a></span>: <i>History</i>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>: <i>History</i>. Only
after great hesitation would Charles X. consent to reopen
negotiations with Denmark direct, at the same time proposing
to exercise pressure upon the enemy by a simultaneous winter
campaign in Norway. Such an enterprise necessitated fresh
subsidies from his already impoverished people, and obliged
him in December 1659 to cross over to Sweden to meet the
estates, whom he had summoned to Gothenburg. The lower
estates murmured at the imposition of fresh burdens; and
Charles had need of all his adroitness to persuade them that his
demands were reasonable and necessary. At the very beginning
of the <i>Riksdag</i>, in January 1660, it was noticed that the king
was ill; but he spared himself as little in the council-chamber
as in the battle-field, till death suddenly overtook him on the
night of the 13th of February 1660, in his thirty-eighth year.
The abrupt cessation of such an inexhaustible fount of enterprise
and energy was a distinct loss to Sweden; and signs are not
wanting that, in his latter years, Charles had begun to feel the
need and value of repose. Had he lived long enough to overcome
his martial ardour, and develop and organize the empire he
helped to create, Sweden might perhaps have remained a great
power to this day. Even so she owes her natural frontiers in
the Scandinavian peninsula to Charles X.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES XI.<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1655-1697), king of Sweden, the only son of
Charles X., and Hedwig Leonora of Holstein-Gottorp, was born
in the palace at Stockholm, on the 24th of November 1655.
His father, who died when the child was in his fourth year,
left the care of his education to the regents whom he had appointed.
So shamefully did they neglect their duty that when,
at the age of seventeen, Charles XI. attained his majority,
he was ignorant of the very rudiments of state-craft and almost
illiterate.    Yet those nearest to him had great hopes of him.
He was known to be truthful, upright and God-fearing; if he
had neglected his studies it was to devote himself to manly
sports and exercises; and in the pursuit of his favourite pastime,
bear-hunting, he had already given proofs of the most splendid
courage.    It was the general disaster produced by the speculative
policy of his former guardians which first called forth his sterling
qualities and hardened him into a premature manhood.    With
indefatigable energy he at once attempted to grapple with the
difficulties of the situation, waging an almost desperate struggle
with sloth,  corruption and incompetence.    Amidst universal
anarchy, the young king, barely twenty years of age, inexperienced,
ill-served, snatching at every expedient, worked day
and night in his newly-formed camp in Scania (Skåne) to arm
the nation for its mortal struggle.    The victory of Fyllebro
(Aug.   17,   1676),  when  Charles and his commander-in-chief
S.G. Helmfeld routed a Danish division, was the first gleam
of good luck, and on the 4th of December, on the tableland
of Helgonabäck, near Lund, the young Swedish monarch defeated
Christian V. of Denmark, who also commanded his army in
person.    After a ferocious contest, the Danes were practically
annihilated.    The battle of Lund was, relatively to the number
engaged, one of the bloodiest engagements of modern times.
More than half the combatants  (8357, of whom 3000 were
Swedes) actually perished on the battle-field.    All the Swedish
commanders showed remarkable ability, but the chief glory
of the day indisputably belongs to Charles XI. This great victory
restored to the Swedes their self-confidence and prestige.    In
the following year, Charles with 9000 men routed 12,000 Danes
near Malmõ (July 15, 1678).    This proved to be the last pitched
battle of the war, the Danes never again venturing to attack
their once more invincible enemy in the open field.    In 1679 Louis
XIV. dictated the terms of a general pacification, and Charles XI,
who bitterly resented &ldquo;the insufferable tutelage&rdquo; of the French
king, was forced at last to acquiesce in a peace which at least
left his empire practically intact.    Charles devoted the rest of his
life to the gigantic task of rehabilitating Sweden by means of a
<i>reduktion</i>, or recovery of alienated crown lands, a process which
involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom,
and resulted in the complete readjustment of the finances.
But vast as it was, the <i>reduktion</i> represents only a tithe of Charles
XI.&rsquo;s immense activity.   The constructive part of his administration
was equally thorough-going, and entirely beneficial.    Here,
too, everything was due to his personal initiative.    Finance,
commerce, the national armaments by sea and land, judicial
procedure, church government, education, even art and science&mdash;everything,
in short&mdash;emerged recast from his shaping hand.
Charles XI. died on the 5th of April 1697, in his forty-first year.
By his beloved consort Ulrica Leonora of Denmark, from the
shock of whose death in July 1693 he never recovered, he had
seven children, of whom only three survived him, a son Charles,
and two daughters, Hedwig Sophia, duchess of Holstein, and
Ulrica Leonora, who ultimately succeeded her brother on the
Swedish throne.    After Gustavus Vasa and Gustavus Adolphus
Charles XI. was, perhaps, the greatest of all the kings of Sweden.
His modest, homespun figure has indeed been unduly eclipsed by
the brilliant and colossal shapes of his heroic father and his
meteoric son; yet in reality Charles XI. is far worthier of
admiration than either Charles X. or Charles XII.   He was in
an eminent degree a great master-builder. He found Sweden
in ruins, and devoted his whole life to laying the solid foundations
of a new order of things which, in its essential features,
has endured to the present day.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES XII.<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (1682-1718), king of Sweden, the only surviving
son of Charles XI. and Ulrica Leonora, daughter of Frederick III.
of Denmark, was born on the 17th of June 1682. He was carefully
educated by excellent tutors under the watchful eyes of his
parents. His natural parts were excellent; and a strong bias
in the direction of abstract thought, and mathematics in particular,
was noticeable at an early date. His memory was astonishing.
He could translate Latin into Swedish or German, or Swedish
or German into Latin at sight. Charles XI. personally supervised
his son&rsquo;s physical training. He was taught to ride before he was
four, at eight was quite at home in his saddle, and when only
eleven, brought down his first bear at a single shot. As he grew
older his father took him on all his rounds, reviewing troops,
inspecting studs, foundries, dockyards and granaries. Thus the
lad was gradually initiated into all the <i>minutiae</i> of administration.
The influence of Charles XI. over his son was, indeed, far greater
than is commonly supposed, and it accounts for much in Charles
XII.&rsquo;s character which is otherwise inexplicable, for instance
his precocious reserve and taciturnity, his dislike of everything
French, and his inordinate contempt for purely diplomatic
methods. On the whole, his early training was admirable; but
the young prince was not allowed the opportunity of gradually
gaining experience under his guardians. At the <i>Riksdag</i> assembled
at Stockholm in 1697, the estates, jealous of the influence of the
regents, offered full sovereignty to the young monarch, the senate
acquiesced, and, after some hesitation, Charles at last declared
that he could not resist the urgent appeal of his subjects and
would take over the government of the realm &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
The subsequent coronation was marked by portentous novelties,
the most significant of which was the king&rsquo;s omission to take
the usual coronation oath, which omission was interpreted to
mean that he considered himself under no obligation to his
subjects. The general opinion of the young king was, however,
still favourable. His conduct was evidently regulated by strict
principle and not by mere caprice. His refusal to countenance
torture as an instrument of judicial investigation, on the
ground that &ldquo;confessions so extorted give no sure criteria for
forming a judgment,&rdquo; showed him to be more humane as well
as more enlightened than the majority of his council, which had
defended the contrary opinion. His intense application to affairs
is noted by the English minister, John Robinson (1650-1723),
who informed his court that there was every prospect of a happy
reign in Sweden, provided his majesty were well served and did
not injure his health by too much work.</p>

<p>The coalition formed against Sweden by Johann Reinhold
Patkul, which resulted in the outbreak of the Great Northern War
(1699), abruptly put an end to Charles XII.&rsquo;s political apprenticeship,
and forced into his hand the sword he was never again to
relinquish. The young king resolved to attack the nearest
of his three enemies&mdash;Denmark&mdash;first. The timidity of the
Danish admiral Ulrik C. Gyldenlõve, and the daring of Charles,
who forced his nervous and protesting admiral to attempt the
passage of the eastern channel of the Sound, the dangerous
<i>flinterend</i>, hitherto reputed to be unnavigable, enabled the
Swedish king to effect a landing at Humleback in Sjaelland (Zealand),
a few miles north of Copenhagen (Aug. 4, 1700). He now
hoped to accomplish what his grandfather, fifty years before,
had vainly attempted&mdash;the destruction of the Danish-Norwegian
monarchy by capturing its capital. But for once prudential
considerations prevailed, and the short and bloodless war
was terminated by the peace of Travendal (Aug. 18), whereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page930" id="page930"></a>930</span>
Frederick IV. conceded full sovereignty to Charles&rsquo;s ally and
kinsman the duke of Gottorp, besides paying him an indemnity
of 200,000 rix-dollars and solemnly engaging to commit no
hostilities against Sweden in future. From Sjaelland Charles
now hastened to Livonia with 8000 men. On the 6th of October
he had reached Pernau, with the intention of first relieving Riga,
but, hearing that Narva was in great straits, he decided to turn
northwards against the tsar. He set out for Narva on the 13th
of November, against the advice of all his generals, who feared
the effect on untried troops of a week&rsquo;s march through a wasted
land, along boggy roads guarded by no fewer than three formidable
passes which a little engineering skill could easily have
made impregnable. Fortunately, the two first passes were
unoccupied; and the third, Pyhäjoggi, was captured by Charles,
who with 400 horsemen put 6000 Russian cavalry to flight.
On the 19th of November the little army reached Lagena, a
village about 9 m. from Narva, whence it signalled its approach
to the beleaguered fortress, and early on the following morning
it advanced in battle array. The attack on the Russian fortified
camp began at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in the midst of a
violent snowstorm; and by nightfall the whole position was in
the hands of the Swedes: the Russian army was annihilated.
The triumph was as cheap as it was crushing; it cost Charles
less than 2000 men.</p>

<p>After Narva, Charles XII. stood at the parting of ways. His
best advisers urged him to turn all his forces against the panic-stricken
Muscovites; to go into winter-quarters amongst them
and live at their expense; to fan into a flame the smouldering
discontent caused by the reforms of Peter the Great, and so
disable Russia for some time to come. But Charles&rsquo;s determination
promptly to punish the treachery of Augustus prevailed
over every other consideration. It is easy from the vantage-point
of two centuries to criticize Charles XII. for neglecting
the Russians to pursue the Saxons; but at the beginning of the
18th century his decision was natural enough. The real question
was, which of the two foes was the more dangerous, and Charles
had many reasons to think the civilized and martial Saxons far
more formidable than the imbecile Muscovites. Charles also
rightly felt that he could never trust the treacherous Augustus
to remain quiet, even if he made peace with him. To leave
such a foe in his rear, while he plunged into the heart of Russia
would have been hazardous indeed. From this point of view
Charles&rsquo;s whole Polish policy, which has been blamed so long
and so loudly&mdash;the policy of placing a nominee of his own on the
Polish throne&mdash;takes quite another complexion: it was a policy
not of overvaulting ambition, but of prudential self-defence.</p>

<p>First, however, Charles cleared Livonia of the invader (July
1701), subsequently occupying the duchy of Courland and
converting it into a Swedish governor-generalship. In January
1702 Charles established himself at Bielowice in Lithuania, and,
after issuing a proclamation declaring that &ldquo;the elector of
Saxony&rdquo; had forfeited the Polish crown, set out for Warsaw,
which he reached on the 14th of May. The cardinal-primate
was then sent for and commanded to summon a diet, for the
purpose of deposing Augustus. A fortnight later Charles quitted
Warsaw, to seek the elector; on the 2nd of July routed the
combined Poles and Saxons at Klissow; and three weeks later,
captured the fortress of Cracow by an act of almost fabulous
audacity. Thus, within four months of the opening of the
campaign, the Polish capital and the coronation city were both
in the possession of the Swedes. After Klissow, Augustus made
every effort to put an end to the war, but Charles would not even
consider his offers. By this time, too, he had conceived a passion
for the perils and adventures of warfare. His character was
hardening, and he deliberately adopted the most barbarous
expedients for converting the Augustan Poles to his views.
Such commands as &ldquo;ravage, singe, and burn all about, and
reduce the whole district to a wilderness!&rdquo;  &ldquo;sweat contributions
well out of them!&rdquo; &ldquo;rather let the innocent suffer than
the guilty escape!&rdquo; became painfully frequent in the mouth
of the young commander, not yet 21, who was far from being
naturally cruel.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1703 was remarkable for Charles&rsquo;s victory
at Pultusk (April 21) and the long siege of Thorn, which occupied
him eight months but cost him only 50 men. On the 2nd of
July 1704, with the assistance of a bribing fund, Charles&rsquo;s
ambassador at Warsaw, Count Arvid Bernard Horn, succeeded
in forcing through the election of Charles&rsquo;s candidate to the
Polish throne, Stanislaus Leszczynski, who could not be crowned
however till the 24th of September 1705, by which time the
Saxons had again been defeated at Punitz. From the autumn
of 1705 to the spring of 1706, Charles was occupied in pursuing
the Russian auxiliary army under Ogilvie through the forests
of Lithuania. On the 5th of August, he recrossed the Vistula
and established himself in Saxony, where his presence in the
heart of Europe, at the very crisis of the war of the Spanish
Succession, fluttered all the western diplomats. The allies,
in particular, at once suspected that Louis XIV. had bought
the Swedes. Marlborough was forthwith sent from the Hague
to the castle of Altranstädt near Leipzig, where Charles had
fixed his headquarters, &ldquo;to endeavour to penetrate the designs&rdquo;
of the king of Sweden. He soon convinced himself that western
Europe had nothing to fear from Charles, and that no bribes
were necessary to turn the Swedish arms from Germany to
Russia. Five months later (Sept. 1707) Augustus was
forced to sign the peace of Altranstädt, whereby he resigned the
Polish throne and renounced every anti-Swedish alliance.
Charles&rsquo;s departure from Saxony was delayed for twelve months
by a quarrel with the emperor. The court of Vienna had treated
the Silesian Protestants with tyrannical severity, in direct
contravention of the treaty of Osnabrück, of which Sweden was
one of the guarantors; and Charles demanded summary and
complete restitution so dictatorially that the emperor prepared
for war. But the allies interfered in Charles&rsquo;s favour, lest he
might be tempted to aid France, and induced the emperor to
satisfy all the Swedish king&rsquo;s demands, the maritime Powers
at the same time agreeing to guarantee the provisions of the
peace of Altranstädt.</p>

<p>Nothing now prevented Charles from turning his victorious
arms against the tsar; and on the 13th of August 1707, he
evacuated Saxony at the head of the largest host he ever commanded,
consisting of 24,000 horse and 20,000 foot. Delayed
during the autumn months in Poland by the tardy arrival of
reinforcements from Pomerania, it was not till November 1707
that Charles was able to take the field. On New Year&rsquo;s Day
1708 he crossed the Vistula, though the ice was in a dangerous
condition. On the 4th of July 1708 he cut in two the line of the
Russian army, 6 m. long, which barred his progress on the Wabis,
near Holowczyn, and compelled it to retreat. The victory of
Holowczyn, memorable besides as the last pitched battle won
by Charles XII., opened up the way to the Dnieper. The
Swedish army now began to suffer severely, bread and fodder
running short, and the soldiers subsisting entirely on captured
bullocks. The Russians slowly retired before the invader,
burning and destroying everything in his path. On the 20th of
December it was plain to Charles himself that Moscow was
inaccessible. But the idea of a retreat was intolerable to him,
so he determined to march southwards instead of northwards
as suggested by his generals, and join his forces with those of the
hetman of the Dnieperian Cossacks, Ivan Mazepa, who had
100,000 horsemen and a fresh and fruitful land at his disposal.
Short of falling back upon Livonia, it was the best plan adoptable
in the circumstances, but it was rendered abortive by Peter&rsquo;s
destruction of Mazepa&rsquo;s capital Baturin, so that when Mazepa
joined Charles at Horki, on the 8th of November 1708, it was as a
ruined man with little more than 1300 personal attendants (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mazepa-Koledinsky</a></span>). A still more serious blow was the
destruction of the relief army which Levenhaupt was bringing to
Charles from Livonia, and which, hampered by hundreds of
loaded wagons, was overtaken and almost destroyed by Peter at
Lyesna after a two days&rsquo; battle against fourfold odds (October).
The very elements now began to fight against the perishing but
still unconquered host. The winter of 1708 was the severest
that Europe had known for a century. By the 1st of November
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page931" id="page931"></a>931</span>
firewood would not ignite in the open air, and the soldiers
warmed themselves over big bonfires of straw. By the time the
army reached the little Ukrainian fortress of Hadjacz in January
1709, wine and spirits froze into solid masses of ice; birds on
the wing fell dead; saliva congealed on its passage from the
mouth to the ground. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; says an eye-witness,
&ldquo;though earth, sea and sky were against us, the king&rsquo;s orders
had to be obeyed and the daily march made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never had Charles XII. seemed so superhuman as during
these awful days. It is not too much to say that his imperturbable
equanimity, his serene <i>bonhomie</i> kept the host together.
The frost broke at the end of February 1709, and then the spring
floods put an end to all active operations till May, when Charles
began the siege of the fortress of Poltava, which he wished to
make a base for subsequent operations while awaiting reinforcements
from Sweden and Poland. On the 7th of June a bullet
wound put Charles <i>hors de combat</i>, whereupon Peter threw the
greater part of his forces over the river Vorskla, which separated
the two armies (June 19-25). On the 26th of June Charles held
a council of war, at which it was resolved to attack the Russians
in their entrenchments on the following day. The Swedes
joyfully accepted the chances of battle and, advancing with
irresistible <i>élan</i>, were, at first, successful on both wings.
Then one or two tactical blunders were committed; and the tsar,
taking courage, enveloped the little band in a vast semicircle
bristling with the most modern guns, which fired five times to
the Swedes&rsquo; once, and swept away the guards before they
could draw their swords. The Swedish infantry was well nigh
annihilated, while the 14,000 cavalry, exhausted and demoralized,
surrendered two days later at Perevolochna on Dnieper. Charles
himself with 1500 horsemen took refuge in Turkish territory.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Charles was now obliged to have
recourse to diplomacy; and his pen proved almost as formidable
as his sword. He procured the dismissal of four Russo-phil
grand-viziers in succession, and between 1710 and 1712 induced
the Porte to declare war against the tsar three times. But after
November 1712 the Porte had no more money to spare; and,
the tsar making a show of submission, the sultan began to regard
Charles as a troublesome guest. On the 1st of February 1713
he was attacked by the Turks in his camp at Bender, and made
prisoner after a contest which reads more like an extravagant
episode from some heroic folk-tale than an incident of sober
18th-century history. Charles lingered on in Turkey fifteen
months longer, in the hope of obtaining a cavalry escort
sufficiently strong to enable him to restore his credit in Poland.
Disappointed of this last hope, and moved by the despairing
appeals of his sister Ulrica and the senate to return to Sweden
while there was still a Sweden to return to, he quitted Demotika
on the 20th of September 1714, and attended by a single squire
arrived unexpectedly at midnight, on the 11th of November,
at Stralsund, which, excepting Wismar, was now all that remained
to him on German soil.</p>

<p>For the diplomatic events of these critical years see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>:
<i>History</i>. Here it need only be said that Sweden, during the
course of the Great Northern War, had innumerable opportunities
of obtaining an honourable and even advantageous peace, but
they all foundered oh the dogged refusal of Charles to consent
to the smallest concession to his despoilers. Even now he would
listen to no offers of compromise, and after defending Stralsund
with desperate courage till it was a mere rubbish heap, returned
to Sweden after an absence of 14 years. Here he collected
another army of 20,000 men, with which he so strongly entrenched
himself on the Scanian coast in 1716 that his combined enemies
shrank from attacking him, whereupon he assumed the offensive
by attacking Norway in 1717, and again in 1718, in order to
conquer sufficient territory to enable him to extort better terms
from his enemies. It was during this second adventure that he
met his death. On the 11th of December, when the Swedish
approaches had come within 280 paces of the fortress of Fredriksten,
which the Swedes were closely besieging, Charles looked
over the parapet of the foremost trench, and was shot through
the head by a bullet from the fortress.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES XIII.<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (1748-1818), king of Sweden and Norway,
the second son of Adolphus Frederick, king of Sweden, and
Louisa Ulrica, sister of Frederick the Great, was born at Stockholm
on the 7th of October 1748. In 1772 he co-operated in the
revolutionary plans of his brother Gustavus III. (<i>q.v.</i>). On the
outbreak of the Russo-Swedish War of 1788 he served with
distinction as admiral of the fleet, especially at the battles of
Hogland (June 17, 1788) and Oland (July 26, 1789). On the
latter occasion he would have won a signal victory but for the
unaccountable remissness of his second-in-command, Admiral
Liljehorn. On the death of Gustavus III., Charles, now duke
of Sudermania, acted as regent of Sweden till 1796; but the real
ruler of the country was the narrow-minded and vindictive
Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm (<i>q.v.</i>), whose mischievous influence
over him was supreme. These four years were perhaps the most
miserable and degrading in Swedish history (an age of lead
succeeding an age of gold, as it has well been called) and may be
briefly described as alternations of fantastic jacobinism and
ruthless despotism. On the accession of Gustavus IV. (November
1796), the duke became a mere cipher in politics till the 13th of
March 1809, when those who had dethroned Gustavus IV.
appointed him regent, and finally elected him king. But by this
time he was prematurely decrepit, and Bernadotte (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Charles
XIV.</a></span>) took over the government as soon as he landed in Sweden
(1810). By the union of 1814 Charles became the first king of
Sweden and Norway. He married his cousin Hedwig Elizabeth
Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp (1759-1818), but their only child,
Carl Adolf, duke of Vermland, died in infancy (1798). Charles
XIII., who for eight years had been king only in title, died on
the 5th of February 1818.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES XIV.<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1763-1844), king of Sweden and Norway,
born at Pau on the 26th of January 1763, was the son of Henri
Bernadotte (1711-1780), procurator at Pau, and Jeanne St Jean
(1725-1809). The family name was originally Deu Pouey,
but was changed into Bernadotte in the beginning of the 17th
century. Bernadotte&rsquo;s christian names were Jean Baptiste;
he added the name Jules subsequently. He entered the French
army on the 3rd of September 1780, and first saw service in
Corsica. On the outbreak of the Revolution his eminent military
qualities brought him speedy promotion. In 1794 we find him
as brigadier attached to the army of the Sambre et Meuse, and
after Jourdan&rsquo;s victory at Fleurus he was appointed a general
of division. At the battle of Theiningen, 1796, he contributed,
more than any one else, to the successful retreat of the French
army over the Rhine after its defeat by the archduke Charles.
In 1797 he brought reinforcements from the Rhine to Bonaparte&rsquo;s
army in Italy, distinguishing himself greatly at the passage of the
Tagliamento, and in 1798 was sent as ambassador to Vienna,
but was compelled to quit his post owing to the disturbances
caused by his hoisting the tricolor over the embassy. On the
16th of August 1798 he married Désirée Clary (1777-1860),
the daughter of a Marseilles banker, and sister of Joseph Bonaparte&rsquo;s
wife. From the 2nd of July to the 14th of September
he was war minister, in which capacity he displayed great ability.
About this time he held aloof from Bonaparte, but though he
declined to help Napoleon in the preparations for the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>
of November 1799, he accepted employment from the Consulate,
and from April 1800 till the 18th of August 1801 commanded
the army in La Vendée. On the introduction of the empire he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page932" id="page932"></a>932</span>
was made one of the eighteen marshals of France, and, from
June 1804 to September 1805, acted as governor of the
recently-occupied Hanover. During the campaign of 1805, Bernadotte
with an army corps from Hanover co-operated in the great
movement which resulted in the shutting up of Mack in Ulm.
He was rewarded for his services at Austerlitz (December 2, 1805)
by the principality of Ponte Corvo (June 5, 1806), but during the
campaign against Prussia, the same year, was severely reproached
by Napoleon for not participating with his army corps in the
battles of Jena and Auerstädt, though close at hand. In 1808,
as governor of the Hanse towns, he was to have directed the
expedition against Sweden, via the Danish islands, but the plan
came to nought because of the want of transports and the
defection of the Spanish contingent. In the war against Austria,
Bernadotte led the Saxon contingent at the battle of Wagram,
on which occasion, on his own initiative he issued an order of
the day, attributing the victory principally to the valour of his
Saxons, which Napoleon at once disavowed.</p>

<p>Bernadotte, considerably piqued, thereupon returned to Paris,
where the council of ministers entrusted him with the defence
of the Netherlands against the English. In 1810 he was about
to enter upon his new post of governor of Rome when he was,
unexpectedly, elected successor to the Swedish throne, partly
because a large part of the Swedish army, in view of future
complications with Russia, were in favour of electing a soldier,
and partly because Bernadotte was very popular in Sweden,
owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners
during the late war with Denmark. The matter was decided
by one of the Swedish couriers, Baron Karl Otto Mörner,
who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to
the Swedish crown to Bernadotte. Bernadotte communicated
Mörner&rsquo;s offer to Napoleon, who treated the whole affair as an
absurdity. Bernadotte thereupon informed Mörner that he
would not refuse the honour if he were duly elected. Although
the Swedish government, amazed at Mörner&rsquo;s effrontery, at once
placed him under arrest on his return to Sweden, the candidature
of Bernadotte gradually gained favour there, and, on the 21st
of August 1810, he was elected crown-prince.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of November Bernadotte made his solemn entry
into Stockholm, and on the 5th he received the homage of the
estates and was adopted by Charles XIII. under the name of
Charles John. The new crown-prince was very soon the most
popular and the most powerful man in Sweden. The infirmity
of the old king and the dissensions in the council of state placed
the government, and especially the control of foreign affairs,
entirely in his hands. The keynote of his whole policy was the
acquisition of Norway, a policy which led him into many tortuous
ways (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>: <i>History</i>), and made him a very tricky ally
during the struggle with Napoleon in 1813. Great Britain and
Prussia very properly insisted that Charles John&rsquo;s first duty
was to them, the former power rigorously protesting against
the expenditure of her subsidies on the nefarious Norwegian
adventure before the common enemy had been crushed. After
the defeats of Lützen and Bautzen, it was the Swedish crown-prince
who put fresh heart into the allies; and at the conference
of Trachenberg he drew up the general plan for the campaign
which began after the expiration of the truce of Pläswitz.
Though undoubtedly sparing his Swedes unduly, to the just
displeasure of the allies, Charles John, as commander-in-chief
of the northern army, successfully defended the approaches to
Berlin against Oudinot in August and against Ney in September;
but after Leipzig he went his own way, determined at all
hazards to cripple Denmark and secure Norway. For the events
which led to the union of Norway and Sweden, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sweden</a></span>: <i>History</i>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Norway</a></span>: <i>History</i>. As unional king, Charles XIV.
(who succeeded to that title in 1818 on the death of Charles XIII.)
was popular in both countries. Though his ultra-conservative
views were detested, and as far as possible opposed (especially
after 1823), his dynasty was never in serious danger, and Swedes
and Norsemen alike were proud of a monarch with a European
reputation. It is true that the <i>Riksdag</i> of 1840 meditated
compelling him to abdicate, but the storm blew over and his jubilee
was celebrated with great enthusiasm in 1843. He died at
Stockholm on the 8th of March 1844. His reign was one of
uninterrupted peace, and the great material development of the
two kingdoms during the first half of the 19th century was
largely due to his energy and foresight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES XV.<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (1826-1872), king of Sweden and Norway,
eldest son of Oscar I., king of Sweden and Norway, and Josephine
Beauharnais of Leuchtenberg, was born on the 3rd of May 1826.
On the 19th of June 1850 he married Louisa, daughter of Prince
Frederick of the Netherlands. He became regent on the 25th
of September 1857, and king on the death of his father (8th of
July 1859). As crown-prince, Charles&rsquo;s brusque and downright
manners had led many to regard his future accession with some
apprehension, yet he proved to be one of the most popular of
Scandinavian kings and a constitutional ruler in the best sense
of the word. His reign was remarkable for its manifold and
far-reaching reforms. Sweden&rsquo;s existing communal law (1862),
ecclesiastical law (1863) and criminal law (1864) were enacted
appropriately enough under the direction of a king whose motto
was: &ldquo;Build up the land upon the laws!&rdquo; Charles XV. also
materially assisted De Geer (<i>q.v.</i>) to carry through his memorable
reform of the constitution in 1863. Charles was a warm advocate
of &ldquo;Scandinavianism&rdquo; and the political solidarity of the three
northern kingdoms, and his warm friendship for Frederick VII.,
it is said, led him to give half promises of help to Denmark on
the eve of the war of 1864, which, in the circumstances, were
perhaps misleading and unjustifiable. In view, however, of the
unpreparedness of the Swedish army and the difficulties of the
situation, Charles was forced to observe a strict neutrality.
He died at Malmö on the 18th of September 1872. Charles XV.
was highly gifted in many directions. He attained to some
eminence as a painter, and his <i>Digte</i> show him to have been
a true poet. He left but one child, a daughter, Louisa Josephina
Eugenia, who in 1869 married the crown-prince Frederick of Denmark.</p>

Guy of Châtillon, count of Blois (d. 1342), and of Marguerite of

of Penthièvre (d. 1384), daughter of Guy of Brittany, count of
Penthièvre (d. 1331), and thus acquired a right to the succession
of the duchy of Brittany. On the death of John III., duke of
Brittany, in April 1341, his brother John, count of Montfort-l&rsquo;Amaury,
and his niece Jeanne, wife of Charles of Blois, disputed
the succession. Charles of Blois, sustained by Philip VI.,
captured John of Montfort, who was supported by King Edward III.
at Nantes, besieged his wife Jeanne of Flanders at Hennebont,
and took Quimper and Guérande (1344). But next year his
partisans were defeated at Cadoret, and in June 1347 he was
himself wounded and taken prisoner at Roche-Derrien. He was
not liberated until 1356, when he continued the war against the
young John of Montfort, and perished in the battle of Auray, on
the 29th of September 1364. Charles bore a high reputation for
piety, and was believed to have performed miracles. The
Roman Church has canonized him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES,<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> called <span class="sc">The Bold</span> (1433-1477), duke of Burgundy,
son of Philip the Good of Burgundy and Isabella of Portugal, was
born at Dijon on the 10th of November 1433. In his father&rsquo;s
lifetime he bore the title of count of Charolais. He was brought
up under the direction of the seigneur d&rsquo;Auxy, and early showed
great application to study and also to warlike exercises. Although
he was on familiar terms with the dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.),
when the latter was a refugee at the court of Burgundy, he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page933" id="page933"></a>933</span>
not but view with chagrin the repurchase by the king of France
of the towns on the Somme, which had been temporarily ceded
to Philip the Good by the treaty of Arras; and when his father&rsquo;s
failing health enabled him to take into his hands the reins of
government (which Philip abandoned to him completely by an
act of the 12th of April 1465), he entered upon his lifelong
struggle against Louis XI., and became one of the principal
leaders of the League of the Public Weal. His brilliant bravery
at the battle of Montlhéry (16th of July 1465), where he was
wounded and was left master of the field, neither prevented the
king from re-entering Paris nor assured Charles a decisive
victory. He succeeded, however, in forcing upon Louis the
treaty of Conflans (1466), by which the king restored to him
the towns on the Somme, and promised him the hand of his infant
daughter Catherine, with Champagne as dowry. In the meanwhile
the count of Charolais obtained the surrender of Ponthieu.
The revolt of Liége and Dinant intervened to divert his attention
from the affairs of France. On the 25th of August 1466 Charles
took possession of Dinant, which he pillaged and sacked, and
succeeded in treating at the same time with the Liégeois. After
the death of Philip the Good (15th June 1467), the Liégeois
renewed hostilities, but Charles defeated them at St Trond, and
made a victorious entry into Liége, which he dismantled and
deprived of some of its privileges.</p>

<p>Alarmed by these early successes of the duke of Burgundy, and
anxious to settle various questions relating to the execution of
the treaty of Conflans, Louis requested a meeting with Charles
and placed himself in his hands at Péronne. In the course of the
negotiations the duke was informed of a fresh revolt of the
Liégeois secretly fomented by Louis. After deliberating for four
days how to deal with his adversary, who had thus maladroitly
placed himself at his mercy, Charles decided to respect
the parole he had given and to treat with Louis (October 1468),
at the same time forcing him to assist in quelling the revolt.
The town was carried by assault and the inhabitants were
massacred, Louis not having the courage to intervene on behalf
of his ancient allies. At the expiry of the one year&rsquo;s truce which
followed the treaty of Péronne, the king accused Charles of
treason, cited him to appear before the parlement, and seized
some of the towns on the Somme (1471). The duke retaliated by
invading France with a large army, taking possession of Nesle
and massacring its inhabitants. He failed, however, in an
attack on Beauvais, and had to content himself with ravaging
the country as far as Rouen, eventually retiring without having
attained any useful result.</p>

<p>Other matters, moreover, engaged his attention. Relinquishing,
if not the stately magnificence, at least the gay and
wasteful profusion which had characterized the court of Burgundy
under the preceding duke, he had bent all his efforts
towards the development of his military and political power.
Since the beginning of his reign he had employed himself in
reorganizing his army and the administration of his territories.
While retaining the principles of feudal recruiting, he had endeavoured
to establish a system of rigid discipline among his
troops, which he had strengthened by taking into his pay
foreign mercenaries, particularly Englishmen and Italians, and by
developing his artillery. Furthermore, he had lost no opportunity
of extending his power. In 1469 the archduke of Austria,
Sigismund, had sold him the county of Ferrette, and the landgraviate
of Alsace and some other towns, reserving to himself the
right to repurchase. In 1472-1473 Charles bought the reversion
of the duchy of Gelderland from its old duke, Arnold, whom
he had supported against the rebellion of his son. Not content
with being &ldquo;the grand duke of the West,&rdquo; he conceived the
project of forming a kingdom of Burgundy or Arles with himself
as independent sovereign, and even persuaded the emperor
Frederick to assent to crown him king at Trier. The ceremony,
however, did not take place owing to the emperor&rsquo;s precipitate
flight by night (September 1473), occasioned by his displeasure
at the duke&rsquo;s attitude. In the following year Charles involved
himself in a series of difficulties and struggles which ultimately
brought about his downfall. He embroiled himself successively
with Sigismund of Austria, to whom he refused to restore his
possessions in Alsace for the stipulated sum; with the Swiss,
who supported the free towns of Alsace in their revolt against
the tyranny of the ducal governor, Peter von Hagenbach (who
was condemned and executed by the rebels in May 1474); and
finally, with René of Lorraine, with whom he disputed the
succession of Lorraine, the possession of which had united the
two principal portions of Charles&rsquo;s territories&mdash;Flanders and the
duchy and county of Burgundy. All these enemies, incited
and supported as they were by Louis, were not long in joining
forces against their common adversary. Charles suffered a first
rebuff in endeavouring to protect his kinsman, the archbishop
of Cologne, against his rebel subjects. He spent ten months
(July 1474-June 1475) in besieging the little town of Neuss on the
Rhine, but was compelled by the approach of a powerful imperial
army to raise the siege. Moreover, the expedition he had persuaded
his brother-in-law, Edward IV. of England, to undertake
against Louis was stopped by the treaty of Picquigny (29th of
August 1475). He was more successful in Lorraine, where he
seized Nancy (30th of November 1475). From Nancy he marched
against the Swiss, hanging and drowning the garrison of Granson
in spite of the capitulation. Some days later, however, he was
attacked before Granson by the confederate army and suffered
a shamful defeat, being compelled to fly with a handful of
attendants, and leaving his artillery and an immense booty
in the hands of the allies (February 1476). He succeeded in
raising a fresh army of 30,000 men, with which he attacked
Morat, but he was again defeated by the Swiss army, assisted
by the cavalry of René of Lorraine (22nd of June 1476). On the
6th of October Charles lost Nancy, which was re-entered by
René. Making a last effort, Charles formed a new army and
arrived in the depth of winter before the walls of Nancy. Having
lost many of his troops through the severe cold, it was with only
a few thousand men that he met the joint forces of the Lorrainers
and the Swiss, who had come to the relief of the town (6th of
January 1477). He himself perished in the fight, his mutilated
body being discovered some days afterwards.</p>

<p>Charles the Bold has often been regarded as the last representative
of the feudal spirit&mdash;a man who possessed no other
quality than a blind bravery&mdash;and accordingly has often been
contrasted with his rival Louis XI. as representing modern
politics. In reality, he was a prince of wide knowledge and
culture, knowing several languages and austere in morals; and
although he cannot be acquitted of occasional harshness, he
had the secret of winning the hearts of his subjects, who never
refused him their support in times of difficulty. He was thrice
married&mdash;to Catherine (d, 1446), daughter of Charles VII. of
France, by whom he had one daughter, Mary, afterwards the
wife of the Emperor Maximilian I.; to Isabella (d. 1465), daughter
of Charles I., duke of Bourbon; and to Margaret of York, sister
of Edward IV. of England, whom he married in 1468.</p>

king of Denmark, by Adela, daughter of Robert the Frisian,
count of Flanders, was born about 1084. After the assassination
of Canute in 1086, his widow took refuge in Flanders, taking
with her her son. Charles was brought up by his mother and
grandfather, Robert the Frisian, on whose death he did great
services to his uncle, Robert II., and his cousin, Baldwin VII.,
counts of Flanders. Baldwin died of a wound received in battle
in 1119, and, having no issue, left by will the succession to
his countship to Charles the Dane. Charles did not secure his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page934" id="page934"></a>934</span>
heritage without a civil war, but he was speedily victorious and
made his position secure by treating his opponents with great
clemency. He now devoted himself to promoting the welfare
of his subjects, and did his utmost to support the cause of
Christianity, both by his bounty and by his example. He
well deserved the surname of <i>Le Bon</i>, by which he is known to
posterity. He refused the offer of the crown of Jerusalem on
the death of Baldwin, and declined to be nominated as a
candidate for the imperial crown in succession to the emperor
Henry V. He was murdered in the church of St Donat at
Bruges on the 2nd of March 1127.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES I.<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> (c. 950-c. 992), duke of Lower Lorraine, was a
younger son of the Frankish king Louis IV., and consequently
a member of the Carolingian family. Unable to obtain the
duchy of Burgundy owing to the opposition of his brother, King
Lothair, he went to the court of his maternal uncle, the emperor
Otto the Great, about 965, and in 977 received from the emperor
Otto II. the duchy of Lower Lorraine. His authority in Lorraine
was nominal; but he aided Otto in his struggle with Lothair,
and on the death of his nephew, Louis V., made an effort to secure
the Frankish crown. Hugh Capet, however, was the successful
candidate and war broke out. Charles had gained some successes
and had captured Reims, when in 991 he was treacherously
seized by Adalberon, bishop of Laon, and handed over to Hugh.
Imprisoned with his wife and children at Orleans, Charles did
not long survive his humiliation. His eldest son Otto, duke of
Lower Lorraine, died in 1005.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (d. 1431), duke of Lorraine, called <span class="sc">The Bold</span>,
is sometimes referred to as Charles I. A son of Duke John I.,
he succeeded his father in 1390; but he neglected his duchy
and passed his life in warfare. He died on the 25th of January
1431, leaving two daughters, one of whom, Isabella (d. 1453),
married René I. of Anjou (1409-1450), king of Naples, who
succeeded his father-in-law as duke of Lorraine.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES III.<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> or <span class="bold">II.</span> (1543-1608), called <span class="sc">The Great</span>, duke of
Lorraine, was a son of Duke Francis I. (d. 1545), and a
descendant of René of Anjou. He was only an infant when he
became duke, and was brought up at the court of Henry II. of
France, marrying Henry&rsquo;s daughter Claude in 1559. He took
part in the wars of religion in France, and was a member of the
League; but he was overshadowed by his kinsmen the Guises,
although he was a possible candidate for the French crown in
1589. The duke, who was an excellent ruler of Lorraine, died
at Nancy on the 14th of May 1608. He had three sons: Henry
(d. 1624) and Francis (d. 1632), who became in turn dukes of
Lorraine, and Charles (d. 1607), bishop of Metz and Strassburg.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES IV.<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> or <span class="bold">III.</span> (1604-1675), duke of Lorraine, was a
son of Duke Francis II., and was born on the 5th of April 1604.
He became duke on the abdication of his father in 1624, and
obtained the duchy of Bar through his marriage with his cousin
Nicole (d. 1657), daughter of Duke Henry. Mixing in the tortuous
politics of his time, he was in continual conflict with the crown
of France, and spent much of his time in assisting her enemies
and in losing and regaining his duchies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lorraine</a></span>). He lived
an adventurous life, and in the intervals between his several
struggles with France fought for the emperor Ferdinand II. at
Nordlingen and elsewhere; talked of succouring Charles I. in
England; and after the conclusion of the treaty of Westphalia
in 1648 entered the service of Spain. He died on the 18th of
September 1675, leaving by his second wife, Beatrix de Cusance
(d. 1663), a son, Charles Henry, count of Vaudemont (1642-1723).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES V.<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> or <span class="bold">IV.</span> (1643-1690), duke of Lorraine, nephew
of Duke Charles IV., was born on the 3rd of April 1643, and in
1664 received a colonelcy in the emperor&rsquo;s army. In the same
year he fought with distinction at the battle of St Gotthard, in
which he captured a standard from the Turks. He was a candidate
for the elective crown of Poland in 1668. In 1670 the
emperor made him general of horse, and during the following
years he was constantly on active service, first against the Turks
and subsequently against the French. At Seneff (1674) he was
wounded. In the same year he was again a candidate for the
Polish crown, but was unsuccessful, John Sobieski, who was to
be associated with him in his greatest feat of arms, being elected.
In 1675, on the death of Charles IV., he rode with a cavalry corps
into the duchy of Lorraine, then occupied by the French, and
secured the adhesion of the Lorraine troops to himself; a little
after this he succeeded Montecucculi as general of the imperial
army on the Rhine, and was made a field marshal. The chief
success of his campaign of 1676 was the capture of Philipsburg,
after a long and arduous siege. The war continued without
decisive result for some time, and the fate of the duchy, which
was still occupied by the French, was the subject of endless
diplomacy. At the general peace Charles had to accept the hard
conditions imposed by Louis XIV., and he never entered into
effective possession of his sovereignty. In 1678 he married the
widowed queen of Poland, Eleonora Maria of Austria, and for
nearly five years they lived quietly at Innsbruck. The Turkish
invasion of 1683, the last great effort of the Turks to impose
their will on Europe, called Charles into the field again. At the
head of a weak imperial army the duke offered the best resistance
he could to the advance of the Turks on Vienna. But he had
to fall back, contesting every position, and the Turks finally
invested Vienna (July 13th, 1683). At this critical moment
other powers came to the assistance of Austria, reinforcements
poured into Charles&rsquo;s camp, and John Sobieski, king of Poland,
brought 27,000 Poles. Sobieski and Charles had now over
80,000 men, Poles, Austrians and Germans, and on the morning
of the 12th of September they moved forward to the attack.
By nightfall the Turks were in complete disorder, Vienna was
relieved, and the danger was at an end. Soon the victors took
the offensive and reconquered part of the kingdom of Hungary.
The Germans and Poles went home in the winter, but Charles
continued his offensive with the imperialists alone. Ofen
(Buda) resisted his efforts in 1684, but in the campaign of
1685 Neuhaüsel was taken by storm, and in 1686 Charles, now
reinforced by German auxiliaries, resumed the siege of Ofen.
All attempts to relieve the place were repulsed, and Ofen was
stormed on the 2nd of September. In the following campaign
the Austrians won a decisive victory on the famous battle-ground
of Mohacs (August 18th, 1687). In 1689 Charles took the field
on the Rhine against the forces of Louis XIV., the enemy of
his house. Mainz and Bonn were taken in the first campaign,
but Charles in travelling from Vienna to the front died suddenly
at Wels on the 18th of April 1690.</p>

<p>His eldest son, Leopold Joseph (1679-1729), at the peace of
Ryswick in 1697 obtained the duchy, of which his father had
been dispossessed by France, and was the father of Francis
Stephen, duke of Lorraine, who became the husband of Maria
Theresa (<i>q.v.</i>), and of Charles (Karl Alexander), a distinguished
Austrian commander in the wars with Frederick the Great.
The duchy was ceded by Francis Stephen to Stanislaus Leczynski,
the dethroned king of Poland, in 1736, Francis receiving instead
the grand-duchy of Tuscany.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES II.<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Charles Louis de Bourbon</span>] (1799-1883),
duke of Parma, succeeded his mother, Maria Louisa, duchess
of Lucca, as duke of Lucca in 1824. He introduced economy
into the administration, increased the schools, and in 1832 as
a reaction against the bigotry of the priests and monks with
which his mother had surrounded him, he became a Protestant.
He at first evinced Liberal tendencies, gave asylum to the
Modenese political refugees of 1831, and was indeed suspected
of being a Carbonaro. But his profligacy and eccentricities
soon made him the laughing-stock of Italy. In 1842 he returned
to the Catholic Church and made Thomas Ward, an English
groom, his prime minister, a man not without ability and tact.
Charles gradually abandoned all his Liberal ideas, and in 1847
declared himself hostile to the reforms introduced by Pius IX.
The Lucchesi demanded the constitution of 1805, promised
them by the treaty of Vienna, and a national guard, but the
duke, in spite of the warnings of Ward, refused all concessions.
A few weeks later he retired to Modena, selling his life-interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page935" id="page935"></a>935</span>
in the duchy to Tuscany. On the 17th of October Maria Louisa
of Austria, duchess of Parma, died, and Charles Louis succeeded
to her throne by the terms of the Florence treaty, assuming the
style of Charles II. His administration of Parma was characterized
by ruinous finance, debts, disorder and increased taxation,
and he concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with
Austria. But on the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 there
were riots in his capital (19th of March), and he declared his
readiness to throw in his lot with Charles Albert, the pope, and
Leopold of Tuscany, repudiated the Austrian treaty and promised
a constitution. Then he again changed his mind, abdicated in
April, and left Parma in the hands of a provisional government,
whereupon the people voted for union with Piedmont. After
the armistice between Charles Albert and Austria (August 1848)
the Austrian general Thurn occupied the duchy, and Charles II.
issued an edict from Weistropp annulling the acts of the
provisional government. When Piedmont attacked Austria again
in 1849, Parma was evacuated, but reoccupied by General
d&rsquo;Aspre in April.</p>

<p>In May 1849 Charles confirmed his abdication, and was
succeeded by his son <span class="sc">Charles III.</span> (1823-1854), who, protected
by Austrian troops, placed Parma under martial law, inflicted
heavy penalties on the members of the late provisional government,
closed the university, and instituted a regular policy of
persecution. A violent ruler, a drunkard and a libertine, he was
assassinated on the 26th of March 1854. At his death his
widow Maria Louisa, sister of the comte de Chambord, became
regent, during the minority of his son Robert. The duchess
introduced some sort of order into the administration, seemed
inclined to rule more mildly and dismissed some of her husband&rsquo;s
more obnoxious ministers, but the riots of the Mazzinians in
July 1854 were repressed with ruthless severity, and the rest
of her reign was characterized by political trials, executions
and imprisonments, to which the revolutionists replied with
assassinations.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Karl Ludwig</span>] (1771-1847), archduke of Austria
and duke of Teschen, third son of the emperor Leopold II., was
born at Florence (his father being then grand-duke of Tuscany)
on the 5th of September 1771. His youth was spent in Tuscany,
at Vienna and in the Austrian Netherlands, where he began his
career of military service in the war of the French Revolution.
He commanded a brigade at Jemappes, and in the campaign of
1793 distinguished himself at the action of Aldenhoven and the
battle of Neerwinden. In this year he became <i>Statthalter</i> in
Belgium and received the army rank of lieutenant field marshal,
which promotion was soon followed by that to Feldzeugmeister.
In the remainder of the war in the Low Countries he held high
commands, and he was present at Fleurus. In 1795 he served
on the Rhine, and in the following year was entrusted with the
chief control of all the Austrian forces on that river. His conduct
of the operations against Jourdan and Moreau in 1796 marked
him out at once as one of the greatest generals in Europe. At
first falling back carefully and avoiding a decision, he finally
marched away, leaving a mere screen in front of Moreau; falling
upon Jourdan he beat him in the battles of Amberg and Würzburg,
and drove him over the Rhine with great loss. He then
turned upon Moreau&rsquo;s army, which he defeated and forced out
of Germany. For this campaign, one of the most brilliant in
modern history, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">French Revolutionary Wars</a></span>. In 1797
he was sent to arrest the victorious march of General Bonaparte
in Italy, and he conducted the retreat of the over-matched
Austrians with the highest skill. In the campaign of 1799 he
was once more opposed to Jourdan, whom he defeated in the
battles of Osterach and Stokach, following up his success by
invading Switzerland and defeating Masséna in the (first)
battle of Zürich, after which he re-entered Germany and drove
the French once more over the Rhine. Ill-health, however,
forced him to retire to Bohemia, whence he was soon recalled to
undertake the task of checking Moreau&rsquo;s advance on Vienna.
The result of the battle of Hohenlinden had, however, foredoomed
the attempt, and the archduke had to make the armistice
of Steyer. His popularity was now such that the diet of
Regensburg, which met in 1802, resolved to erect a statue in his
honour and to give him the title of saviour of his country; but
Charles refused both distinctions.</p>

<p>In the short and disastrous war of 1805 the archduke Charles
commanded what was intended to be the main army, in Italy,
but events made Germany the decisive theatre of operations,
and the defeats sustained on the Danube neutralized the success
obtained by the archduke over Masséna in the desperately fought
battle of Caldiero. With the conclusion of peace began his active
work of army reorganization, which was first tested on the field
in 1809. As generalissimo of the army he had been made field
marshal some years before. As president of the Council of War,
and supported by the prestige of being the only general who
had proved capable of defeating the French, he promptly initiated
a far-reaching scheme of reform, which replaced the obsolete
methods of the 18th century, the chief characteristics of the
new order being the adoption of the &ldquo;nation in arms&rdquo; principle
and of the French war organization and tactics. The new army
was surprised in the process of transition by the war of 1809, in
which Charles commanded in chief; yet even so it proved a far
more formidable opponent than the old, and, against the now
heterogeneous army of which Napoleon disposed (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic
Campaigns</a></span>) it succumbed only after a desperate struggle.
Its initial successes were neutralized by the reverses of Abensberg,
Landshut and Eckmühl; but, after the evacuation of
Vienna, the archduke won the great battle of Aspern-Essling
(<i>q.v.</i>) and soon afterwards fought the still more desperate battle
of Wagram (<i>q.v.</i>), at the close of which the Austrians were defeated
but not routed; they had inflicted upon Napoleon a loss
of over 50,000 men in the two battles. At the end of the campaign
the archduke gave up all his military offices, and spent
the rest of his life in retirement, except a short time in 1815,
when he was governor of Mainz. In 1822 he succeeded to the
duchy of Saxe-Teschen. The archduke Charles married, in 1815,
Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (d. 1829). He had four
sons, the eldest of whom, the archduke Albert (<i>q.v.</i>) became one
of the most celebrated generals in Europe, and two daughters,
the elder of whom became queen of Naples. He died at Vienna
on the 30th of April 1847. An equestrian statue was erected
to his memory in Vienna, 1860.</p>

<p>The caution which the archduke preached so earnestly in his
strategical works, he displayed in practice only when the situation
seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced
him in favour of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same
time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive
strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether
in wide turning movements, as at Würzburg and Zürich, or
in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to
that of any leader of his time, Napoleon only excepted. The
campaign of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained
defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical
superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the
condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks&rsquo;
inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavourable
criticism. As a military writer, his position in the
evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines
had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless they cannot
but be considered as antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the
importance of &ldquo;strategic points&rdquo; are the chief features of his
system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be
gathered from the prescription that &ldquo;this principle is <i>never</i> to
be departed from.&rdquo; Again and again he repeats the advice that
nothing should be hazarded unless one&rsquo;s army is <i>completely</i> secure,
a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in
1796. &ldquo;Strategic points,&rdquo; he says (not the defeat of the enemy&rsquo;s
army), &ldquo;decide the fate of one&rsquo;s own country, and must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page936" id="page936"></a>936</span>
constantly remain the general&rsquo;s main solicitude&rdquo;&mdash;a maxim which
was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809.
The editor of the archduke&rsquo;s work is able to make but a feeble
defence against Clausewitz&rsquo;s reproach that Charles attached
more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In
his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve
in battle is designed to &ldquo;cover a retreat.&rdquo; The baneful influence
of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance
of Königgrätz-Josefstadt in 1866 as a &ldquo;strategic point,&rdquo;
which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian
armies; in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign
of 1859, and in the &ldquo;almost unintelligible&rdquo; battle of
Montebello in the same year. The theory and the practice of
the archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in
military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed,
along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made
him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1525-1574), cardinal of Lorraine, French statesman,
was the second son of Claude of Lorraine, duke of Guise,
and brother of Francis, duke of Guise. He was archbishop of
Reims in 1538, and cardinal in 1547. At first he was called the
cardinal of Guise, but in 1550, on the death of his uncle John,
cardinal of Lorraine, he in his turn took the style of cardinal of
Lorraine. Brilliant, cunning and a master of intrigue, he was,
like all the Guises, devoured with ambition and devoid of scruples.
He had, said Brantôme, &ldquo;a soul exceeding smirched,&rdquo; and, he
adds, &ldquo;by nature he was exceeding craven.&rdquo; Together with
his brother, Duke Francis, the cardinal of Lorraine was all-powerful
during the reigns of Henry II. and Francis II.; in
1558 and 1559 he was one of the negotiators of the treaty of
Cateau-Cambrésis; he fought and pitilessly persecuted the
reformers, and by his intolerant policy helped to provoke the
crisis of the wars of religion. The death of Francis II. deprived
him of power, but he remained one of the principal leaders of the
Catholic party. In 1561, at the Colloquy of Poissy, he was
commissioned to reply to Theodore Beza. In 1562 he went to the
council of Trent, where he at first defended the rights of the
Gallican Church against the pretensions of the pope; but after
the assassination of his brother, he approached the court of
Rome, and on his return to France he endeavoured, but without
success, to obtain the promulgation of the decrees of the council
(1564). In 1567, when the Protestants took up arms, he held
for some time the first place in the king&rsquo;s council, but Catherine
de&rsquo; Medici soon grew weary of his arrogance, and in 1570 he had
to leave the court. He endeavoured to regain favour by
negotiating at Rome the dispensation for the marriage of Henry
of Navarre with Margaret of Valois (1572). He died on the 26th
of December 1574, at the beginning of the reign of Henry III.
An orator of talent, he left several harangues or sermons, among
them being <i>Oraison prononcée au Colloque de Poissy</i> (Paris, 1562)
and <i>Oratio habita in Concil. Trident.</i> (<i>Concil. Trident. Orationes</i>,
Louvain, 1567).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Karl Alexander</span>] (1712-1780), prince of Lorraine,
was the youngest son of Leopold, duke of Lorraine, and
grandson of Charles V., duke of Lorraine (see above), the famous
general. He was born at Lunéville on the 12th of December
1712, and educated for a military career. After his elder brother
Francis, the duke, had exchanged Lorraine for Tuscany and
married Maria Theresa, Charles became an Austrian officer,
and he served in the campaigns of 1737 and 1738 against the
Turks. At the outbreak of the Silesian wars in 1740 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Austrian Succession, War of the</a></span>), the queen made her
brother-in-law a field marshal, though he was not yet thirty
years old, and in 1742 Charles encountered Frederick the Great
for the first time at the battle of Chotusitz (May 17th). The
victory of the Prussians on that field was far from decisive, and
Charles drew off his forces in good order. His conduct of the
successful campaign of 1743 against the French and Bavarians
heightened his reputation. He married, in January 1744,
Marianne of Austria, sister of Maria Theresa, who made them
jointly governors-general of the Austrian Netherlands. Very
soon the war broke out afresh, and Charles, at the head of the
Austrian army on the Rhine, won great renown by his brilliant
crossing of the Rhine. Once more a Lorraine prince at the head
of Austrian troops invaded the duchy and drove the French
before him, but at this moment Frederick resumed the Silesian
war, all available troops were called back to oppose him, and the
French maintained their hold on Lorraine. Charles hurried to
Bohemia, whence, aided by the advice of the veteran field
marshal Traun, he quickly expelled the Prussians. At the close
of his victorious campaign he received the news that his wife,
to whom he was deeply attached, had died in childbirth on the
16th of December 1744 at Brussels. He took the field again in
1745 in Silesia, but this time without the advice of Traun, and
he was twice severely defeated by Frederick, at Hohenfriedberg
and at Soor. Subsequently, as commander-in-chief in the Low
Countries he received, at Roucoux, a heavy defeat at the hands
of Marshal Saxe. His government of the Austrian Netherlands
during the peace of 1749-1756 was marked by many reforms,
and the prince won the regard of the people by his ceaseless
activity on their behalf. After the first reverses of the Seven
Years&rsquo; War (<i>q.v.</i>), Maria Theresa called Charles again to the
supreme command in the field. The campaign of 1757 opened
with Frederick&rsquo;s great victory of Prague, and Prince Charles was
shut up with his army in that fortress. In the victory of the
relieving army under Daun at Kolin Charles had no part. Nevertheless
the battle of Breslau, in which the Prussians suffered a
defeat even more serious than that of Kolin, was won by him,
and great enthusiasm was displayed in Austria over the victory,
which seemed to be the final blow to Frederick. But soon afterwards
the king of Prussia routed the French at Rossbach, and,
swiftly returning to Silesia, he inflicted on Charles the complete
and crushing defeat of Leuthen (December 5, 1757). A mere
remnant of the Austrian army reassembled after the pursuit,
and Charles was relieved of his command. He received, however,
from the hands of the empress the grand cross, of the newly
founded order of Maria Theresa. For a year thereafter Prince
Charles acted as a military adviser at Vienna, he then returned
to Brussels, where, during the remainder of his life, he continued
to govern in the same liberal spirit as before. The affection of
the people for the prince was displayed during his dangerous
illness in 1765, and in 1775 the estates of Brabant erected a
statue in his honour at Brussels. He died on the 4th of July
1780 at the castle of Tervoeren, and was buried with his Lorraine
ancestors at Nancy.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (1270-1325), count of Valois, of Maine, and of
Anjou, third son of Philip III., king of France, surnamed the
Bold, and of Isabella of Aragon, was born on the 12th of March
1270. By his father&rsquo;s will he inherited the four lordships of
Crépy, La Ferté-Milon, Pierrefonds and Béthisy, which together
formed the countship of Valois. In 1284 Martin IV., having
excommunicated Pedro III., king of Aragon, offered that
kingdom to Charles. King Philip failed in an attempt to place
his son on this throne, and died on the return of the expedition.
In 1290 Charles married Margaret, daughter of Charles II.,
king of Naples, and renounced his pretensions to Aragon. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page937" id="page937"></a>937</span>
1294, at the beginning of the hostilities against England, he
invaded Guienne and took La Réole and Saint-Sever. During
the war Flanders (1300), he took Douai, Béthune and Dam,
received the submission of Guy of Dampierre, and aided King
Philip IV., the Fair, to gain the battle of Mons-en-Pévèle, on the
18th of August 1304. Asked by Boniface VIII. for his aid
against the Ghibellines, he crossed the Alps in June 1301, entered
Florence, and helped Charles II., the Lame, king of Sicily, to
reconquer Calabria and Apulia from the house of Aragon, but
was defeated in Sicily. As after the death of his first wife
Charles had married Catherine de Courtenay, a granddaughter of
Baldwin II., the last Latin emperor of Constantinople, he tried
to assert his rights to that throne. Philip the Fair also wished
to get him elected emperor; but Clement V. quashed his candidature
in favour of Henry of Luxemburg, afterwards the
emperor Henry VII. Under Louis X. Charles headed the party
of feudal reaction, and was among those who compassed the
ruin of Enguerrand de Marigny. In the reign of Charles IV.,
the Fair, he fought yet again in Guienne (1324), and died at
Perray (Seine-et-Oise) on the 16th of December 1325. His
second wife had died in 1307, and in July 1308 he had married
a third wife, Mahaut de Châtillon, countess of Saint-Pol. Philip,
his eldest son, ascended the French throne in 1328, and from
him sprang the royal house of Valois.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1421-1461), prince of Viana, sometimes called
Charles IV. king of Navarre, was the son of John, afterwards
John II., king of Aragon, by his marriage with Blanche, daughter
and heiress of Charles III., king of Navarre. Both his grandfather
Charles and his mother, who ruled over Navarre from 1425
to 1441, had bequeathed this kingdom to Charles, whose right
had also been recognized by the Cortes; but when Blanche
died in 1441 her husband John seized the government to the
exclusion of his son. The ill-feeling between father and son
was increased when in 1447 John took for his second wife Joanna
Henriquez, a Castilian princess, who soon bore him a son,
afterwards Ferdinand I. king of Spain, and who regarded her
stepson as an interloper. When Joanna began to interfere in
the internal affairs of Navarre civil war broke out; and in 1452
Charles, although aided by John II., king of Castile, was defeated
and taken prisoner. Released upon promising not to take the
kingly title until after his father&rsquo;s death, the prince, again
unsuccessful in an appeal to arms, took refuge in Italy with
Alphonso V., king of Aragon, Naples and Sicily. In 1458
Alphonso died and John became king of Aragon, while Charles
was offered the crowns of Naples and Sicily. He declined these
proposals, and having been reconciled with his father returned
to Navarre in 1459. Aspiring to marry a Castilian princess,
he was then thrown into prison by his father, and the Catalans
rose in his favour. This insurrection soon became general and
John was obliged to yield. He released his son, and recognized
him as perpetual governor of Catalonia, and heir to the kingdom.
Soon afterwards, however, on the 23rd of September 1461, the
prince died at Barcelona, not without a suspicion that he had
been poisoned by his stepmother. Charles was a cultured and
amiable prince, fond of music and literature. He translated
the <i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle into Spanish, a work first published at
Saragossa in 1509, and wrote a chronicle of the kings of Navarre,
<i>Crónica de los reyes de Navarra</i>, an edition which, edited by
J. Yangues y Miranda, was published at Pampeluna in 1843.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES, ELIZABETH<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> (1828-1896), English author, was
born at Tavistock on the 2nd of January 1828, the daughter of
John Rundle, M.P. Some of her youthful poems won the praise
of Tennyson, who read them in manuscript. In 1851 she married
Andrew Paton Charles. Her best known book, written to order
for an editor who wished for a story about Martin Luther, <i>The
Chronicles of the Schönberg-Cotta Family</i>, was published in 1862,
and was translated into most of the European languages, into
Arabic, and into many Indian dialects. Mrs Charles wrote in all
some fifty books, the majority of a semi-religious character.
She took an active part in the work of various charitable institutions,
and among her friends and correspondents were Dean
Stanley, Archbishop Tait, Charles Kingsley, Jowett and Pusey.

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES, JACQUES ALEXANDRE CÉSAR<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (1746-1823),
French mathematician and physicist, was born at Beaugency,
Loiret, on the 12th of November 1746. After spending some
years as a clerk in the ministry of finance, he turned to scientific
pursuits, and attracted considerable attention by his skilful and
elaborate demonstrations of physical experiments. He was the
first, in 1783, to employ hydrogen for the inflation of balloons
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aeronautics</a></span>), and about 1787 he anticipated Gay Lussac&rsquo;s
law of the dilatation of gases with heat, which on that account
is sometimes known by his name. In 1785 he was elected to
the Academy of Sciences, and subsequently he became professor
of physics at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. He died in
Paris on the 7th of April 1823. His published papers are chiefly
concerned with mathematical topics.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES, THOMAS<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (1755-1814), Welsh Nonconformist
divine, was born of humble parentage at Longmoor, in the parish
of Llanfihangel Abercywyn, near St Clears, Carmarthenshire,
on the 14th of October 1755. He was educated for the Anglican
ministry at Llanddowror and Carmarthen, and at Jesus College,
Oxford (1775-1778). In 1777 he studied theology under the
evangelical John Newton at Olney. He was ordained deacon
in 1778 on the title of the curacies of Shepton Beauchamp and
Sparkford, Somerset; and took priest&rsquo;s orders in 1780. He
afterwards added to his charge at Sparkford, Lovington, South
Barrow and North Barrow, and in September 1782 was presented
to the perpetual curacy of South Barrow by the Rev. John
Hughes, Coln St Denys. But he never left Sparkford, though
the contrary has been maintained, until he resigned all his
curacies in June 1783, and returned to Wales, marrying (on
August 20th) Sarah Jones of Bala, the orphan of a flourishing
shopkeeper. He had early fallen under the influence of the
great revival movement in Wales, and at the age of seventeen
had been &ldquo;converted&rdquo; by a sermon of Daniel Rowland&rsquo;s. This
was enough to make him unpopular with many of the Welsh
clergy, and being denied the privilege of preaching for nothing
at two churches, he helped his old Oxford friend John Mayor,
now vicar of Shawbury, Shropshire, from October until January
11th, 1784. On the 25th of January he took charge of Llan yn
Mowddwy (14 m. from Bala), but was not allowed to continue
there more than three months. Three influential people, among
them the rector of Bala, agitated some of the parishioners
against him, and persuaded his rector to dismiss him. His
preaching, his catechizing of the children after evensong, and
his connexion with the Bala Methodists&mdash;his wife&rsquo;s step-father
being a Methodist preacher&mdash;gave great offence. After a fortnight
more at Shawbury, he wrote to John Newton and another
clergyman friend in London for advice. The Church of England
denied him employment, and the Methodists desired his services.
His friends advised him to return to England, but it was too late.
By September he had crossed the Rubicon, Henry Newman (his
rector at Shepton Beauchamp and Sparkford) accompanying
him on a tour in Carnarvonshire. In December, he was preaching
at the Bont Uchel Association; so that he joined the Methodists
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Calvinistic Methodists</a></span>) in 1784.</p>

<p>Before taking this step, he had been wont in his enforced
leisure to gather the poor children of Bala into his house for instruction,
and so thickly did they come that he had to adjourn
with them to the chapel. This was the origin of the Welsh
Circulating Schools, which he developed on the lines adopted by
Griffith Jones (d. 1761), formerly vicar of Llanddowror. First
one man was trained for the work by himself, then he was sent
to a district for six months, where, (for £8 a year) he taught gratis
the children and young people (in fact, all comers) reading and
Christian principles. Writing was added later. The expenses
were met by collections made in the Calvinistic Methodist
Societies, and as the funds increased masters were multiplied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page938" id="page938"></a>938</span>
until in 1786 Charles had seven masters to whom he paid £10 per
annum; in 1787, twelve; in 1789, fifteen; in 1794, twenty.
By this time the salary had been increased to £12; in 1801 it was
£14. He had learnt of Raikes&rsquo;s Sunday Schools before he left
the Establishment, but he rightly considered the system set on
foot by himself far superior; the work and object being the same,
he gave six days&rsquo; tuition for every one given by them, and many
people not only objected to working as teachers on Sunday, but
thought the children forgot in the six days what they learnt on
the one. But Sunday Schools were first adopted by Charles to
meet the case of young people in service who could not attend
during the week, and even in that form much opposition was
shown to them because teaching was thought to be a form of
Sabbath breaking. His first Sunday School was in 1787. Wilberforce,
Charles Grant, John Thornton and his son Henry, were
among the philanthropists who contributed to his funds; in 1798
the Sunday School Society (established 1785) extended its
operations to Wales, making him its agent, and Sunday Schools
grew rapidly in number and favour. A powerful revival broke
out at Bala in the autumn of 1791, and his account of it in letters
to correspondents, sent without his knowledge to magazines,
kindled a similar fire at Huntly. The scarcity of Welsh bibles
was Charles&rsquo;s greatest difficulty in his work. John Thornton and
Thomas Scott helped him to secure supplies from the Society for
the Promotion of Christian Knowledge from 1787 to 1789, when
the stock became all but exhausted. In 1799 a new edition was
brought out by the Society, and he managed to secure 700 copies
of the 10,000 issued; the Sunday School Society got 3000 testaments
printed, and most of them passed into his hands in 1801.</p>

<p>In 1800, when a frost-bitten thumb gave him great pain and
much fear for his life, his friend, Rev. Philip Oliver of Chester,
died, leaving him director and one of three trustees over his
chapel at Boughton; and this added much to his anxiety. The
Welsh causes at Manchester and London, too, gave him much
uneasiness, and burdened him with great responsibilities at this
juncture. In November 1802 he went to London, and on the 7th
of December he sat at a committee meeting of the Religious
Tract Society, as a country member, when his friend, Joseph
Tarn&mdash;a member of the Spa Fields and Religious Tract Society
committees&mdash;introduced the subject of a regular supply of
bibles for Wales. Charles was asked to state his case to the
committee, and so forcibly did he impress them, that it was there
and then decided to move in the matter of a general dispersion
of the bible. When he visited London a year later, his friends
were ready to discuss the name of a new Society, and the sole object
of which should be to supply bibles. Charles returned to Wales
on the 30th of January 1804, and the British and Foreign Bible
Society was formally and publicly inaugurated on March the 7th.
The first Welsh testament issued by that Society appeared on the
6th of May 1806, the bible on the 7th of May 1807&mdash;both being
edited by Charles.</p>

<p>Between 1805 and 1811 he issued his Biblical Dictionary in
four volumes, which still remains the standard work of its kind in
Welsh. Three editions of his Welsh catechism were published
for the use of his schools (1789, 1791 and 1794); an English
catechism for the use of schools in Lady Huntingdon&rsquo;s Connexion
was drawn up by him in 1797; his shorter catechism in Welsh
appeared in 1799, and passed through several editions, in Welsh
and English, before 1807, when his <i>Instructor</i> (still the Connexional
catechism) appeared. From April 1799 to December 1801 six
numbers of a Welsh magazine called <i>Trysorfa Ysprydol</i>
(Spiritual Treasury) were edited by Thomas Jones of Mold and
himself; in March 1809 the first number of the second volume
appeared, and the twelfth and last in November 1813.</p>

<p>The London Hibernian Society asked him to accompany Dr
David Bogue, the Rev. Joseph Hughes, and Samuel Mills to
Ireland in August 1807, to report on the state of Protestant
religion in the country. Their report is still extant, and among
the movements initiated as a result of their visit was the Circulating
School system. In 1810, owing to the growth of Methodism
and the lack of ordained ministers, he led the Connexion in the
movement for connexionally ordained ministers, and his influence
was the chief factor in the success of that important step. From
1811 to 1814 his energy was mainly devoted to establishing
auxiliary Bible Societies. By correspondence he stimulated some
friends in Edinburgh to establish charity schools in the Highlands,
and the Gaelic School Society (1811) was his idea. His last
work was a corrected edition of the Welsh Bible issued in small
pica by the Bible Society. As a preacher he was in great request,
though possessing but few of the qualities of the popular preacher.
All his work received very small remuneration; the family was
maintained by the profits of a business managed by Mrs Charles&mdash;a
keen, active and good woman. He died on the 5th of
October 1814. His influence is still felt, and he is rightly claimed
as one of the makers of modern Wales.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES ALBERT<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Carlo Alberto</span>] (1798-1849), king of
Sardinia (Piedmont), son of Prince Charles of Savoy-Carignano
and Princess Albertine of Saxe-Courland, was born on the 2nd of
October 1798, a few days before the French occupied Piedmont
and forced his cousin King Charles Emmanuel to take refuge
in Sardinia. Although Prince and Princess Carignano adhered
to the French Republican régime, they soon fell under suspicion
and were summoned to Paris. Prince Charles died in 1800, and
his widow married a Count de Montléart and for some years led
a wandering existence, chiefly in Switzerland, neglecting her son
and giving him mere scraps of education, now under a devotee of
J.J. Rousseau, now under a Genevan Calvinist. In 1802 King
Charles Emmanuel abdicated in favour of his brother Victor
Emmanuel I.; the latter&rsquo;s only son being dead, his brother
Charles Felix was heir to the throne, and after him Charles Albert.
On the fall of Napoleon in 1814 the Piedmontese court returned
to Turin and the king was anxious to secure the succession for
Charles Albert, knowing that Austria meditated excluding him
from it in favour of an Austrian archduke, but at the same time he
regarded him as an objectionable person on account of his revolutionary
upbringing. Charles Albert was summoned to Turin,
given tutors to instruct him in legitimist principles, and on the
1st of October 1817 married the archduchess Maria Theresa of
Tuscany, who, on the 14th of March 1820, gave birth to Victor
Emmanuel, afterwards king of Italy.</p>

<p>The Piedmontese government at this time was most reactionary,
and had made a clean sweep of all French institutions.
But there were strong Italian nationalists and anti-Austrian
tendencies among the younger nobles and army officers, and the
Carbonari and other revolutionary societies had made much
progress.</p>

<p>Their hopes centred in the young Carignano, whose agreeable
manners had endeared him to all, and who had many friends
among the Liberals and Carbonari. Early in 1820 a revolutionary
movement was set on foot, and vague plans of combined risings
all over Italy and a war with Austria were talked of. Charles
Albert no doubt was aware of this, but he never actually became
a Carbonaro, and was surprised and startled when after the
outbreak of the Neapolitan revolution of 1820 some of the leading
conspirators in the Piedmontese army, including Count Santorre
di Santarosa and Count San Marzano, informed him that a
military rising was ready and that they counted on his help
(2nd March 1821). He induced them to delay the outbreak
and informed the king, requesting him, however, not to punish
anyone. On the 10th the garrison of Alessandria mutinied,
and two days later Turin was in the hands of the insurgents,
the people demanding the Spanish constitution. The king at
once abdicated and appointed Charles Albert regent. The latter,
pressed by the revolutionists and abandoned by his ministers,
granted the constitution and sent to inform Charles Felix, who
was now king, of the occurrence. Charles Felix, who was then
at Modena, repudiated the regent&rsquo;s acts, accepted Austrian
military assistance, with which the rising was easily quelled,
and exiled Charles Albert to Florence. The young prince found
himself the most unpopular man in Italy, for while the Liberals
looked on him as a traitor, to the king and the Conservatives he
was a dangerous revolutionist. At the Congress of Verona
(1822) the Austrian chancellor, Prince Metternich, tried to induce
Charles Felix to set aside Charles Albert&rsquo;s rights of succession.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page939" id="page939"></a>939</span>
But the king was piqued by Austria&rsquo;s interference, and as both
the grand-duke of Tuscany and the duke of Wellington supported
him, Charles Albert&rsquo;s claims were respected. France having
decided to intervene in the Spanish revolution on the side of
autocracy, Charles Albert asked permission to join the duc
d&rsquo;Angoulême&rsquo;s expedition. The king granted it and the young
prince set out for Spain, where he fought with such gallantry
at the storming of the Trocadero (1st of September 1823) that
the French soldiers proclaimed him the &ldquo;first Grenadier of
France.&rdquo; But it was not until he had signed a secret undertaking
binding himself, as soon as he ascended the throne, to place
himself under the tutelage of a council composed of the higher
clergy and the knights of the Annunziata, and to maintain the
existing forms of the monarchy (D. Berti, <i>Cesare Alfieri</i>, xi. 77,
Rome, 1871), that he was allowed to return to Turin and forgiven.</p>

<p>On the death of Charles Felix (27th of April 1831) Charles
Albert succeeded; he inherited a kingdom without an army,
with an empty treasury, a chaotic administration and medieval
laws. His first task was to set his house in order; he reorganized
the finances, created the army, and started Piedmont on a path
which if not liberalism was at least progress. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; wrote
his reactionary minister, Count della Margherita, &ldquo;hostile to
Austria from the depths of his soul and full of illusions as to the
possibility of freeing Italy from dependence on her.... As
for the revolutionaries, he detested them but feared them, and
was convinced that sooner or later he would be their victim.&rdquo;
In 1833 a conspiracy of the <i>Giovane Italia</i> Society, organized by
Mazzini, was discovered, and a number of its members punished
with ruthless severity. On the election in 1846 of Pius IX., who
appeared to be a Liberal and an Italian patriot, the eyes of all
Italy were turned on him as the heaven-born leader who was to
rescue the country from the foreigner. This to some extent
reconciled the king to the Liberal movement, for it accorded
with his religious views. &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; he wrote to the marquis of
Villamarina, in 1847, &ldquo;that a war of national independence
which should have for its object the defence of the pope would
be the greatest happiness that could befall me.&rdquo; On the 30th of
October he issued a decree granting wide reforms, and when
risings broke out in other parts of Italy early in 1848 and further
liberties were demanded, he was at last induced to grant the
constitution (8th February).</p>

<p>When the news of the Milanese revolt against the Austrians
reached Turin (19th of March) public opinion demanded that the
Piedmontese should succour their struggling brothers; and
after some hesitation the king declared war. But much time
had been wasted and many precious opportunities lost. With
an army of 60,000 Piedmontese troops and 30,000 men from
other parts of Italy the king took the field, and after defeating
the Austrians at Pastrengo on the 30th of April, and at Goito
on the 30th of May, where he was himself slightly wounded,
more time was wasted in useless operations. Radetzky, the
Austrian general, having received reinforcements, drove the
centre of the extended Italian line back across the Mincio (23rd
of July), and in the two days&rsquo; fighting at Custozza (24th and 25th
of July) the Piedmontese were beaten, forced to retreat, and to
ask for an armistice. On re-entering Milan Charles Albert was
badly received and reviled as a traitor by the Republicans,
and although he declared himself ready to die defending the
city the municipality treated with Radetzky for a capitulation;
the mob, urged on by the demagogues, made a savage demonstration
against him at the Palazzo Greppi, whence he escaped in
the night with difficulty and returned to Piedmont with his
defeated <span class="correction" title="amended from armp">army</span>. The French Republic offered to intervene in
the spring of 1848, but Charles Albert did not desire foreign aid,
the more so as in this case it would have had to be paid for by
the cession of Nice and Savoy. The revolutionary movement
throughout Italy was breaking down, but Charles Albert felt
that while he possessed an army he could not abandon the
Lombards and Venetians, and determined to stake all on a last
chance. On the 12th of March 1849 he denounced the armistice
and took the field again with an army of 80,000 men, but gave
the chief command to the Polish general Chrzanowski. General
Ramorino commanding the Lombard division proved unable
to prevent the Austrians from crossing the Ticino (20th of April),
and Chrzanowski was completely out-generalled and defeated
at La Bicocca near Novara on the 23rd. The Piedmontese fought
with great bravery, and the unhappy king sought death in vain.
After the battle he asked terms of Radetzky, who demanded
the occupation by Austria of a large part of Piedmont and the
heir to the throne as a hostage. Thereupon, feeling himself to
be the obstacle to better conditions, Charles Albert abdicated in
favour of his son Victor Emmanuel. That same night he
departed alone and made his way to Oporto, where he retired
into a monastery and died on the 28th of July 1849.</p>

<p>Charles Albert was not a man of first-rate ability; he was of
a hopelessly vacillating character. Devout and mystical to an
almost morbid degree, hating revolution and distrusting Liberalism,
he was a confirmed pessimist, yet he had many noble
qualities: he was brave to the verge of foolhardiness, devoted
to his country, and ready to risk his crown to free Italy from
the foreigner. To him the people of Italy owe a great debt, for
if he failed in his object he at least materialized the idea of the
Risorgimento in a practical shape, and the charges which the
Republicans and demagogues brought against him were monstrously
unjust.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES AUGUSTUS<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Karl August</span>] (1757-1828), grand-duke
of Saxe-Weimar, son of Constantine, duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach,
and Anna Amalia of Brunswick, was born on the 3rd
of September 1757. His father died when he was only nine
months old, and the boy was brought up under the regency and
supervision of his mother, a woman of enlightened but masterful
temperament. His governor was Count Eustach von Görz,
a German nobleman of the old strait-laced school; but a more
humane element was introduced into his training when, in 1771,
Wieland was appointed his tutor. In 1774 the poet Karl Ludwig
von Knebel came to Weimar as tutor to the young Prince
Constantine; and in the same year the two princes set out,
with Count Görz and Knebel, for Paris. At Frankfort, Knebel
introduced Karl August to the young Goethe: the beginning
of a momentous friendship. In 1775 Karl August returned
to Weimar, and the same year came of age and married Princess
Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the young grand-duke was to summon
Goethe to Weimar, and in 1776 he was made a member of the
privy council. &ldquo;People of discernment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;congratulate
me on possessing this man. His intellect, his genius is known.
It makes no difference if the world is offended because I have
made Dr Goethe a member of my most important <i>collegium</i>
without his having passed through the stages of minor official
professor and councillor of state.&rdquo; To the undiscerning, the
beneficial effect of this appointment was not at once apparent.
With Goethe the &ldquo;storm and stress&rdquo; spirit descended upon
Weimar, and the stiff traditions of the little court dissolved in
a riot of youthful exuberance. The duke was a deep drinker,
but also a good sportsman; and the revels of the court were
alternated with break-neck rides across country, ending in nights
spent round the camp fire under the stars. Karl August, however,
had more serious tastes. He was interested in literature, in art,
in science; critics, unsuspected of flattery, praised his judgment
in painting; biologists found in him an expert in anatomy. Nor
did he neglect the government of his little state. His reforms
were the outcome of something more than the spirit of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page940" id="page940"></a>940</span>
&ldquo;enlightened despots&rdquo; of the 18th century; for from the first
he had realized that the powers of the prince to play &ldquo;earthly
providence&rdquo; were strictly limited. His aim, then, was to
educate his people to work out their own political and social
salvation, the object of education being in his view, as he explained
later to the dismay of Metternich and his school, to help
men to &ldquo;independence of judgment.&rdquo; To this end Herder was
summoned to Weimar to reform the educational system; and
it is little wonder that, under a patron so enlightened, the
university of Jena attained the zenith of its fame, and Weimar
became the intellectual centre of Germany.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the affairs of Germany and of Europe the
character of Karl August gave him an influence out of all proportion
to his position as a sovereign prince. He had early faced
the problem presented by the decay of the Empire, and began
to work for the unity of Germany. The plans of the emperor
Joseph II., which threatened to absorb a great part of Germany
into the heterogeneous Habsburg monarchy, threw him into the
arms of Prussia, and he was the prime mover in the establishment
of the league of princes (<i>Furstenbund</i>) in 1785, by which,
under the leadership of Frederick the Great, Joseph&rsquo;s intrigues
were frustrated. He was, however, under no illusion as to the
power of Austria, and he wisely refused the offer of the Hungarian
crown, made to him in 1787 by Prussia at the instance
of the Magyar malcontents, with the dry remark that he had no
desire to be another &ldquo;Winter King.&rdquo; In 1788 Karl August took
service in the Prussian army as major-general in active command
of a regiment. As such he was present, with Goethe, at the
cannonade of Valmy in 1792, and in 1794 at the siege of Mainz
and the battles of Pirmasenz (September 14) and Kaiserslautern
(October 28-30). After this, dissatisfied with the attitude of the
powers, he resigned; but rejoined on the accession of his friend
King Frederick William III. to the Prussian throne. The
disastrous campaign of Jena (1806) followed; on the 14th of
October, the day after the battle, Weimar was sacked; and
Karl August, to prevent the confiscation of his territories, was
forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine. From this time
till after the Moscow campaign of 1812 his contingent fought
under the French flag in all Napoleon&rsquo;s wars. In 1813, however,
he joined the Grand Alliance, and at the beginning of 1814 took
the command of a corps of 30,000 men operating in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>At the congress of Vienna Karl August was present in person,
and protested vainly against the narrow policy of the powers
in confining their debates to the &ldquo;rights of the princes&rdquo; to the
exclusion of the &ldquo;rights of the people.&rdquo; His services in the war
of liberation were rewarded with an extension of territory and
the title of grand-duke; but his liberal attitude had already
made him suspect, and his subsequent action brought him still
further into antagonism to the reactionary powers. He was
the first of the German princes to grant a liberal constitution to
his state under Article XIII. of the Act of Confederation (May 5,
1816); and his concession of full liberty to the press made
Weimar for a while the focus of journalistic agitation against
the existing order. Metternich dubbed him contemptuously
&ldquo;der grosse Bursche&rdquo; for his patronage of the &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;
<i>Burschenschaften</i>; and the celebrated &ldquo;festival&rdquo; held at the
Wartburg by his permission in 1818, though in effect the mildest
of political demonstrations, brought down upon him the wrath
of the great powers. Karl August, against his better judgment,
was compelled to yield to the remonstrances of Prussia, Austria
and Russia; the liberty of the press was again restricted in the
grand-duchy, but, thanks to the good understanding between
the grand-duke and his people, the régime of the Carlsbad
Decrees pressed less heavily upon Weimar than upon other
German states.</p>

<p>Karl August died on the 14th of June 1828. Upon his contemporaries
of the most various types his personality made a great
impression. Karl von Dalberg, the prince-primate, who owed
the coadjutorship of Mainz to the duke&rsquo;s friendship, said that
he had never met a prince &ldquo;with so much understanding,
character, frankness and true-heartedness&rdquo;; the Milanese, when
he visited their city, called him the &ldquo;uomo principe&rdquo;; and
Goethe himself said of him &ldquo;he had the gift of discriminating
intellects and characters and setting each one in his place. He
was inspired by the noblest good-will, the purest humanity, and
with his whole soul desired only what was best. There was in
him something of the divine. He would gladly have wrought
the happiness of all mankind. And finally, he was greater than
his surroundings,... Everywhere he himself saw and judged,
and in all circumstances his surest foundation was in himself.&rdquo;
He left two sons: Charles Frederick (d. 1853), by whom he was
succeeded, and Bernhard, duke of Saxe-Weimar (1792-1862), a
distinguished soldier, who, after the congress of Vienna, became
colonel of a regiment in the service of the king of the Netherlands,
distinguished himself as commander of the Dutch troops in the
Belgian campaign of 1830, and from 1847 to 1850 held the command
of the forces in the Dutch East Indies. Bernhard&rsquo;s son,
William Augustus Edward, known as Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar
(1823-1902), entered the British army, served with
much distinction in the Crimean War, and became colonel of the
1st Life Guards and a field marshal; in 1851 he contracted
a morganatic marriage with Lady Augusta Gordon-Lennox
(d. 1904), daughter of the 5th duke of Richmond and Gordon,
who in Germany received the title of countess of Dornburg, but
was granted the rank of princess in Great Britain by royal
decree in 1866. Karl August&rsquo;s only daughter, Caroline, married
Frederick Louis, hereditary grand-duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
and was the mother of Helene (1814-1858), wife of
Ferdinand, duke of Orleans, eldest son of King Louis Philippe.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLES EDWARD<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Charles Edward Louis Philip
Casimir Stuart</span>] (1720-1788), English prince, called the
&ldquo;Young Pretender&rdquo; and also the &ldquo;Young Chevalier,&rdquo; was
born at Rome on December 31st, 1720. He was the grandson
of King James II. of England and elder son of James, the &ldquo;Old
Pretender,&rdquo; by whom (as James III.) he was created at his birth
prince of Wales, the title he bore among the English Jacobites
during his father&rsquo;s lifetime. The young prince was educated at
his father&rsquo;s miniature court in Rome, with James Murray,
Jacobite earl of Dunbar, for his governor, and under various
tutors, amongst whom were the learned Chevalier Ramsay,
Sir Thomas Sheridan and the abbé Légoux. He quickly became
conversant with the English, French and Italian languages,
but all his extant letters written in English appear singularly
ill-spelt and illiterate. In 1734 his cousin, the duke of Liria,
afterwards duke of Berwick, who was proceeding to join Don
Carlos in his struggle for the crown of Naples, passed through
Rome. He offered to take Charles on his expedition, and the
boy of thirteen, having been appointed general of artillery by
Don Carlos, shared with credit the dangers of the successful
siege of Gaeta.</p>

<p>The handsome and accomplished youth, whose doings were
eagerly reported by the English ambassador at Florence and
by the spy, John Walton, at Rome, was now introduced by his
father and the pope to the highest Italian society, which he
fascinated by the frankness of his manner and the grace and
dignity of his bearing. In 1737 James despatched his son
on a tour through the chief Italian cities, that his education as
a prince and man of the world might be completed. The distinction
with which he was received on his journey, the royal
honours paid to him in Venice, and the jealous interference of
the English ambassador in regard to his reception by the grand-duke
of Tuscany, show how great was the respect in which the
exiled house was held at this period by foreign Catholic powers,
as well as the watchful policy of England in regard to its fortunes.
The Old Pretender himself calculated upon foreign aid in his
attempts to restore the monarchy of the Stuarts; and the idea
of rebellion unassisted by invasion or by support of any kind
from abroad was one which it was left for Charles Edward to
endeavour to realize. Of all the European nations France was
the one on which Jacobite hopes mainly rested, and the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page941" id="page941"></a>941</span>
sympathy which Cardinal Tencin, who had succeeded Fleury
as French minister, felt for the Old Pretender resulted in a
definite scheme for an invasion of England to be timed simultaneously
with a prearranged Scottish rebellion. Charles was
secretly despatched to Paris in January 1744. A squadron
under Admiral Roquefeuil sailed from the coast of France.
Transports containing 7000 troops, to be led by Marshal Saxe,
accompanied by the young prince, were in readiness to set sail
for England. A severe storm effected, however, a complete
disaster without any actual engagement taking place.</p>

<p>The loss in ships of the line, in transports, and in lives was a
crushing blow to the hopes of Charles, who remained in France
for over a year in a retirement which he keenly felt. He had
at Rome already made the acquaintance of Lord Elcho and of
John Murray of Broughton; at Paris he had seen many supporters
of the Stuart cause; he was aware that in every European
court the Jacobites were represented in earnest intrigue; and
he had now taken a considerable share in correspondence and
other actual work connected with the promotion of his own and
his father&rsquo;s interests. Although dissuaded by all his friends,
on the 13th of July 1745 he sailed from Nantes for Scotland on
board the small brig &ldquo;La Doutelle,&rdquo; which was accompanied
by a French man-of-war, the &ldquo;Elisabeth,&rdquo; laden with arms and
ammunition. The latter fell in with an English man-of-war, the
&ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; and had to return to France; Charles escaped during
the engagement, and at length arrived on the 2nd of August off
Erisca, a little island of the Hebrides. Receiving, however, but
a cool reception from Macdonald of Boisdale, he set sail again
and arrived at the bay of Lochnanuagh on the west coast of
Inverness-shire.</p>

<p>The Macdonalds of Clanranald and Kinloch Moidart, along
with other chieftains, again attempted to dissuade him from
the rashness of an unaided rising, but they yielded at last to the
enthusiasm and charm of his manner, and Charles landed on
Scottish soil in the company of the &ldquo;Seven Men of Moidart&rdquo;
who had come with him from France. Everywhere, however,
he met with discouragement among the chiefs, whose adherence
he wished to secure; but at last, by enlisting the support of
Cameron of Lochiel, he gained a footing for a serious rebellion.
With secrecy and speed communications were entered into with
the known leaders of the Highland clans, and on the 19th of
August, in the valley of Glenfinnan, the standard of James III.
and VIII. was raised in the midst of a motley but increasing
crowd. On the same day Sir John Cope at the head of 1500 men
left Edinburgh in search of Charles; but, fearing an attack in
the Pass of Corryarrick, he changed his proposed route to
Inverness, and Charles thus had the undefended south country
before him. In the beginning of September he entered Perth,
having gained numerous accessions to his forces on his march.
Crossing the Forth unopposed at the Fords of Frew and passing
through Stirling and Linlithgow, he arrived within a few miles
of the astonished metropolis, and on the 16th of September a
body of his skirmishers defeated the dragoons of Colonel Gardiner
in what was known as the &ldquo;Canter of Coltbrig.&rdquo; His success
was still further augmented by his being enabled to enter the
city, a few of Cameron&rsquo;s Highlanders having on the following
morning, by a happy ruse, forced their way through the Canon-gate.
On the 18th he publicly proclaimed James VIII. of Scotland
at the Market Cross and occupied Holyrood.</p>

<p>Cope had by this time brought his disappointed forces by sea
to Dunbar. On the 20th Charles met and defeated him at
Prestonpans, and returned to prosecute the siege of Edinburgh
Castle, which, however, he raised on General Guest&rsquo;s threatening
to lay the city in ruins. In the beginning of November Charles
left Edinburgh, never to return. He was at the head of at least
6000 men; but the ranks were being gradually thinned by the
desertion of Highlanders, whose traditions had led them to
consider war merely as a raid and an immediate return with
plunder. Having passed through Kelso, on the 9th of November
he laid siege to Carlisle, which capitulated in a week. Manchester
received the prince with a warm welcome and with 150 recruits
under Francis Towneley. On the 4th of December he had reached
Derby and was within ten days&rsquo; march of London, where the
inhabitants were terror-struck and a commercial panic immediately
ensued. Two armies under English leadership were now
in the field against him, one under Marshal Wade, whom he
had evaded by entering England by the west, and the other
under William, duke of Cumberland, who had returned from the
continent. London was not to be supposed helpless in such an
emergency; Manchester, Glasgow and Dumfries, rid of his
presence, had risen against him, and Charles paused. There was
division among his advisers and desertion among his men, and
on the 6th of December he reluctantly was forced to begin his
retreat northward. Closely pursued by Cumberland, he marched
by way of Carlisle across the border, and at last stopped to invest
Stirling Castle. At Falkirk, on the 17th of January 1746, he
defeated General Hawley, who had marched from Edinburgh
to intercept his retreat. A fortnight later, however, Charles
raised the siege of Stirling, and after a weary though successful
march rested his troops at Inverness. Having taken Forts
George and Augustus, and after varying success against the
supporters of the government in the north, he at last prepared
to face the duke of Cumberland, who had passed the early spring
at Aberdeen. On the 8th of April the duke marched thence to
meet Charles, whose little army, exhausted with a futile night
march, half-starving, and broken by desertion, was completely
worsted at Culloden on the 16th of April 1746.</p>

<p>This decisive and cruel defeat sealed the fate of Charles Edward
and the house of Stuart. Accompanied by the faithful Ned
Burke and a few other followers, Charles at last gained the wild
western coast. Hunted hither and thither, he wandered on foot
or cruised restlessly in open boats among the many barren isles of
the Scottish shore, enduring the greatest hardships with marvellous
courage and cheerfulness. Charles, upon whose head a reward
£30,000 had a year before been set, was thus for over five
months relentlessly pursued by the troops and spies of the
government. Disguised in female attire and aided by a passport
obtained by the devoted Flora Macdonald, he passed through
Skye and parted from his gallant conductress at Portree. Towards
the end of July he took refuge in the cave of Coiraghoth
in the Braes of Glenmoriston, and in August he joined Lochiel
and Cluny Macpherson, with whom he remained in hiding until
the news was brought that two French ships were in waiting
for him at the place of his first arrival in Scotland&mdash;Lochnanuagh.
He embarked with speed and sailed for France, reaching the
little port of Roscoff, near Morlaix, on the 29th of September
1746. He was warmly welcomed by Louis XV., and ere long
he was again vigorously intriguing in Paris, and even in Madrid.
So far as political assistance was concerned, his efforts proved
fruitless, but he became at once the popular hero and idol of
the people of Paris. So enraged was he with his brother
Henry&rsquo;s acceptance of a cardinal&rsquo;s hat in July 1747, that he
deliberately broke off communication with his father in Rome
(who had approved the step), nor did he ever see him again.
The enmity of the British government to Charles Edward made
peace with France an impossibility so long as she continued to
harbour the young prince. A condition of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
concluded in October 1748, was that every member
of the house of Stuart should be expelled the French dominions.
Charles had forestalled the proclamation of the treaty by an
indignant protest against its injustice, and a declaration that he
would not be bound by its provisions. But his indignation and
persistent refusal to comply with the request that he should
voluntarily leave France had to be met at last with force: he
was apprehended, imprisoned for a week at Vincennes, and on
the 17th of December conducted to the French border. He
lingered at Avignon; but the French, compelled to hard
measures by the English, refused to be satisfied; and Pope
Benedict XIV., alarmed by the threat of a bombardment of
Civita Vecchia, advised the prince to withdraw. Charles quietly
disappeared; for years Europe watched for him in vain. It is
now established, almost with certainty, that he returned to
the neighbourhood of Paris; and it is supposed that his residence
was known to the French ministers, who, however, firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page942" id="page942"></a>942</span>
proclaimed their ignorance. In 1750, and again, it is thought,
in 1754, he was in London, hatching futile plots and risking his
safety for his hopeless cause, and even abjuring the Roman
Catholic faith in order to further his political interests.</p>

<p>During the next ten years of his life Charles Edward&rsquo;s illicit
connexion with Miss Clementina Walkinshaw (d. 1802), whom
he had first met at Bannockburn House while conducting the
siege of Stirling, his imperious fretful temper, his drunken habits
and debauched life, could no longer be concealed. He wandered
over Europe in disguise, alienating the friends and crushing the
hopes of his party; and in 1766, on returning to Rome at the
death of his father, he was treated by Pope Clement XIII. with
coldness, and his title as heir to the British throne was openly
repudiated by all the great Catholic powers. It was probably
through the influence of the French court, still intriguing against
England, that the marriage between Charles (now self-styled
count of Albany) and Princess Louise of Stolberg was arranged
in 1772. The union proved childless and unhappy, and in 1780
the countess fled for refuge from her husband&rsquo;s drunken violence
to a convent in Florence, where Charles had been residing since
1774. Later, the countess of Albany (<i>q.v.</i>) threw herself on the
protection of her brother-in-law Henry, Cardinal York, at Rome,
and the formal separation between the ill-matched pair was
finally brought about in 1784, chiefly through the kind offices
of King Gustavus III. of Sweden. Charles, lonely, ill, and
evidently near death, now summoned to Florence his natural
daughter, Charlotte Stuart, the child of Clementina Walkinshaw,
born at Liége in October 1753 and hitherto neglected by the
prince. Charlotte Stuart, who was declared legitimate and
created duchess of Albany, tended her father for the remaining
years of his life, during which she contrived to reconcile the two
Stuart brothers, so that in 1785 Charles returned to Rome, where
he died in the old Palazzo Muti on the 30th of January 1788.
He was buried in his brother&rsquo;s cathedral church at Frascati, but
in 1807 his remains were removed to the <i>Grotte Vaticane</i> of
St Peter&rsquo;s. His daughter Charlotte survived her father less than
two years, dying unmarried at Bologna in November 1789, at
the early age of thirty-six.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES EMMANUEL I.<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Carlo Emanuele</span>] (1562-1630),
duke of Savoy, succeeded his father, Emmanuel Philibert,
in 1580. He continued the latter&rsquo;s policy of profiting by the
rivalry of France and Spain in order to round off and extend
his dominions. His three chief objects were the conquest of
Geneva, of Saluzzo and of Monferrato. Saluzzo he succeeded
in wresting from France in 1588. He intervened in the French
religious wars, and also fought with Bern and other Swiss
cantons, and on the murder of Henry III. of France in 1580 he
aspired to the French throne on the strength of the claims of his
wife Catherine, sister of Henry of Navarre, afterwards King
Henry IV. In 1590 he sent an expedition to Provence in the
interests of the Catholic League, and followed it himself later,
but the peace of 1593, by which Henry of Navarre was recognized
as king of France, put an end to his ambitions. In the war
between France and Spain Charles sided with the latter, with
varying success. Finally, by the peace of Lyons (1601), he gave
up all territories beyond the Rhone, but his possession of Saluzzo
was confirmed. He now meditated a further enterprise against
Geneva; but his attempt to capture the city by treachery and
with the help of Spain (the famous <i>escalade</i>) in 1602 failed completely.
The next few years were filled with negotiations and
intrigues with Spain and France which did not lead to any
particular result, but on the death in 1612 of Duke Francesco
Gonzaga of Mantua, who was lord of Monferrato, Charles Emmanuel
made a successful <i>coup de main</i> on that district. This
arrayed the Venetians, Tuscany, the Empire and Spain against
him, and he was obliged to relinquish his conquest. The
Spaniards invaded the duchy from Lombardy, and although the
duke was defeated several times he fought bravely, gained some
successes, and the terms of the peace of 1618 left him more or
less in the <i>status quo ante.</i> We next find Charles Emmanuel
aspiring to the imperial crown in 1619, but without success.
In 1628 he was in alliance with Spain in the war against France;
the French invaded the duchy, which, being abandoned by
Spain, was overrun by their armies. The duke fought desperately,
but was taken ill at Savigliano and died in 1630. He was
succeeded by his son Victor Amedeo I., while his third son
Tommaso founded the line of Savoy-Carignano from which the
present royal house of Italy is descended. Charles Emmanuel
achieved a great reputation as a statesman and warrior, and
increased the prestige of Savoy, but he was too shifty and ingenious,
and his schemes ended in disaster.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLES MARTEL<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span><a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (<i>c.</i> 688-741), Frankish ruler, was a
natural son of Pippin II., mayor of the palace, and Chalpaïda.
Charles was baptized by St Rigobert, bishop of Reims. At the
death of his father in 714, Pippin&rsquo;s widow Plectrude claimed the
government in Austrasia and Neustria in the name of her grandchildren,
and had Charles thrown into prison. But the Neustrians
threw off the Austrasian yoke and entered into an offensive
alliance with the Frisians and Saxons. In the general anarchy
Charles succeeded in escaping, defeated the Neustrians at
Amblève, south of Liége, in 716, and at Vincy, near Cambrai, in
717, and forced them to come to terms. In Austrasia he wrested
the power from Plectrude, and took the title of mayor of the
palace, thus prejudicing the interests of his nephews. According
to the Frankish custom he proclaimed a king in Austrasia in the
person of the young Clotaire IV., but in reality Charles was the
sole master&mdash;the entry in the annals for the year 717 being
&ldquo;Carolus regnare coepit.&rdquo; Once in possession of Austrasia,
Charles sought to extend his dominion over Neustria also. In
719 he defeated Ragenfrid, the Neustrian mayor of the palace,
at Soissons, and forced him to retreat to Angers. Ragenfrid
died in 731, and from that time Charles had no competitor in
the western kingdom. He obliged the inhabitants of Burgundy
to submit, and disposed of the Burgundian bishoprics and countships
to his <i>leudes</i>. In Aquitaine Duke Odo (Eudes) exercised
independent authority, but in 719 Charles forced him to recognize
the suzerainty of northern France, at least nominally. After
the alliance between Charles and Odo on the field of Poitiers,
the mayor of the palace left Aquitaine to Odo&rsquo;s son Hunald,
who paid homage to him. Besides establishing a certain unity
in Gaul, Charles saved it from a very great peril. In 711 the
Arabs had conquered Spain. In 720 they crossed the Pyrenees,
seized Narbonensis, a dependency of the kingdom of the Visigoths,
and advanced on Gaul. By his able policy Odo succeeded
in arresting their progress for some years; but a new vali, Abdur
Rahman, a member of an extremely fanatical sect, resumed the
attack, reached Poitiers, and advanced on Tours, the holy town
of Gaul. In October 732&mdash;just 100 years after the death of
Mahomet&mdash;Charles gained a brilliant victory over Abdur
Rahman, who was called back to Africa by the revolts of the
Berbers and had to give up the struggle. This was the last of
the great Arab invasions of Europe. After his victory Charles
took the offensive, and endeavoured to wrest Narbonensis from
the Mussulmans. Although he was not successful in his attempt
to recover Narbonne (737), he destroyed the fortresses of Agde,
Béziers and Maguelonne, and set fire to the amphitheatre at
Nîmes. He subdued also the Germanic tribes; annexed Frisia,
where Christianity was beginning to make progress; put an end
to the duchy of Alemannia; intervened in the internal affairs
of the dukes of Bavaria; made expeditions into Saxony; and
in 738 compelled some of the Saxon tribes to pay him tribute.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page943" id="page943"></a>943</span>
He also gave St Boniface a safe conduct for his missions in
Thuringia, Alemannia and Bavaria.</p>

<p>During the government of Charles Martel important changes
appear to have been made in the internal administration. Under
him began the great assemblies of nobles known as the <i>champs
de Mars</i>. To attach his <i>leudes</i> Charles had to give them church
lands as <i>precarium</i>, and this had a very great influence in the
development of the feudal system. It was from the <i>precarium</i>,
or ecclesiastical benefice, that the feudal fief originated. Vassalage,
too, acquired a greater consistency at this period, and its
rules began to crystallize. Under Charles occurred the first
attempt at reconciliation between the papacy and the Franks.
Pope Gregory III., menaced by the Lombards, invoked the aid
of Charles (739), sent him a deputation with the keys of the
Holy Sepulchre and the chains of St Peter, and offered to break
with the emperor and Constantinople, and to give Charles the
Roman consulate (<i>ut a partibus imperatoris recederet et Romanum
consulatum Carolo sanciret</i>). This proposal, though unsuccessful,
was the starting-point of a new papal policy. Since the death of
Theuderich IV. in 737 there had been no king of the Franks.
In 741 Charles divided the kingdom between his two sons, as
though he were himself master of the realm. To the elder,
Carloman, he gave Austrasia, Alemannia and Thuringia, with
suzerainty over Bavaria; the younger, Pippin, received Neustria,
Burgundy and Provence. Shortly after this division of the
kingdom Charles died at Quierzy on the 22nd of October 741,
and was buried at St Denis. The characters of Charles Martel
and his grandson Charlemagne offer many striking points of
resemblance. Both were men of courage and activity, and the
two men are often confused in the <i>chansons de geste</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLESTON,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Coles county,
Illinois, U.S.A., in the E. part of the state, about 45 m. W.
of Terre Haute, Indiana. Pop. (1900) 5488; (1910) 5884. It
is served by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St Louis, and
the Toledo, St Louis &amp; Western railways, and by interurban
electric lines. It is the seat of the Eastern Illinois state normal
school (opened in 1899). The city is situated in an important
broom-corn raising district, and has broom factories, a tile
factory and planing mills. The water-works are owned and
operated by the municipality. Charleston was settled about
1835, was incorporated in 1839, and was reincorporated in 1865.
One of the Lincoln-Douglas debates was held here in 1858.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARLESTON,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> the largest city of South Carolina, U.S.A.,
the county-seat of Charleston county, a port of entry, and an
important South Atlantic seaport, on a narrow peninsula
formed by the Cooper river on the E. and the Ashley on the W.
and S.W., and within sight of the ocean about 7 m. distant.
Pop. (1890) 54,955; (1900) 55,807, of whom 31,522 were of negro
descent and 2592 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 58,833.
It is served by the Atlantic Coast Line and the Southern railways,
the Clyde Steamship Line to New York, Boston and Jacksonville,
the Baltimore &amp; Carolina Steamship Co. to Baltimore and
Georgetown, and a branch of the North German Lloyd Steamship
Co., which brings immigrants from Europe direct to the Southern
states; there are freight boat lines to ports in the West Indies,
Central America and other foreign countries.</p>

<p>The city extends over 3.76 sq. m. of surface, nowhere rising
more than 8 or 10 ft. above the rivers, and has about 9 m. of
water front. In the middle of the harbour, on a small island
near its entrance, is the famous Fort Sumter; a little to the
north-east, on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, is the scarcely less historic
Fort Moultrie, as well as extensive modern fortifications; on
James Island, opposite, is Fort Johnson, now the United States
Quarantine Station, and farther up, on the other islands, are
Fort Ripley and Castle Pinckney (now the United States buoy
station). Viewed from any of these forts, Charleston&rsquo;s spires
and public buildings seem to rise out of the sea. The streets
are shaded with the live oak and the linden, and are ornamented
with the palmetto; and the quaint specimens of colonial architecture,
numerous pillared porticoes, spacious verandas&mdash;both
upper and lower&mdash;and flower gardens made beautiful with
magnolias, palmettoes, azaleas, jessamines, camelias and roses,
give the city a peculiarly picturesque character.</p>

<p>King Street, running north and south through the middle
of the peninsula, and Market Street, crossing it about 1 m. from
its lower end, are lined with stores, shops or stalls; on Broad
Street are many of the office buildings and banks; the wholesale
houses are for the most part on Meeting Street, the first thoroughfare
east of King; nearly all of the wharves are on the east side;
the finest residences are at the lower end of the peninsula on
East Battery and South Battery, on Meeting Street below
Broad, on Legare Street, on Broad Street and on Rutledge
Avenue to the west of King. At the south-east corner of Broad
and Meeting streets is Saint Michael&rsquo;s (built in 1752-1761),
the oldest church edifice in the city, and a fine specimen of colonial
ecclesiastical architecture; in its tower is an excellent chime
of eight bells. Beneath the vestry room lie the remains of
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and in the churchyard are the
graves of John Rutledge, James Louis Petigru (1789-1863), and
Robert Young Hayne. At the intersection of the same streets
are also the massive United States post office building (Italian
Renaissance in style), with walls of granite; the county court
house, the city hall and Washington Square&mdash;in which stand a
statue of William Pitt (one arm of which was broken off by a
cannon shot during the British bombardment in 1780), and a
monument to the memory of Henry Timrod (1829-1867), the
poet. At the foot of Broad Street is the Colonial Exchange
in which the South Carolina convention organized a new government
during the War of Independence; and at the foot of
Market Street is the large modern custom house of white marble,
built in the Roman-Corinthian style. Saint Philip&rsquo;s church,
with admirable architectural proportions, has a steeple nearly
200 ft. in height, from which a beacon light shines for the guidance
of mariners far out at sea. In the west cemetery of this church
are the tombs of John C. Calhoun, and of Robert James Turnbull
(1775-1833), who was prominent locally as a nullifier and under
the name of &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; wrote ably on behalf of nullification,
free trade and state&rsquo;s rights. The French Protestant Church,
though small, is an attractive specimen of Gothic architecture;
and the Unitarian, which is in the Perpendicular style and is
modelled after the chapel of Edward VI. in Westminster, has
a beautiful fan-tracery ceiling.</p>

<p>Of the few small city squares, gardens or parks, the White
Point Garden at the lower end of the peninsula is most frequented;
it is shaded with beautiful live oaks, is adorned with palmettoes
and commands a fine view of the harbour. About 1½ m. north
of this on Meeting Street is Marion Square, with a tall graceful
monument to the memory of John C. Calhoun on the south
side, and the South Carolina Military Academy along the north
border. The largest park in Charleston is Hampton Park,
named in honour of General Wade Hampton. It is situated in
the north-west part of the city and is beautifully laid out. The
Isle of Palms, to the north of Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, has a large
pavilion and a wide sandy beach with a fine surf for bathing,
and is the most popular resort for visitors. The Magnolia
Gardens are about 8 m. up the Ashley. Twenty-two miles
beyond is the town of Summerville (pop. in 1900, 2420), a
health resort in the pine lands, with one of the largest tea farms
in the country. Magnolia Cemetery, the principal burial-place,
is a short distance north of the city limits; in it are the graves
of William Washington (1732-1810) and Hugh Swinton Legaré.
Charleston was the home of the Pinckneys, the Rutledges, the
Gadsdens, the Laurenses, and, in a later generation, of W.G.
Simms. A trace of the early social organization of the brilliant
colonial town remains in the St Cecilia Society, first formed in
1737 as an amateur concert society.</p>

<p>Charleston has an excellent system of public schools. Foremost
among the educational institutions is the college of Charleston,
chartered in 1785 and again in 1791, and opened in 1790;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page944" id="page944"></a>944</span>
it is supported by the city and by funds of its own, ranks high
within the state, and has a large and well-equipped museum of
natural history, probably founded as early as 1777 and transferred
to the college in 1850. Here, too, are the Medical College of
the state of South Carolina, which includes a department of
pharmacy; the South Carolina Military Academy (opened in
1843), which is a branch of the University of South Carolina;
the Porter Military Academy (Protestant Episcopal), the
Confederate home school for young women, the Charleston
University School, and the Avery Normal Institute (Congregationalist)
for coloured students. In the Charleston library
(about 25,000 volumes), founded in 1748, are important collections
of rare books and manuscripts; the rooms of the South
Carolina Historical Society are in the same building. The
Charleston <i>News and Courier</i>, published first as the <i>Courier</i> in
1803 and combined with the <i>Daily News</i> (1865) in 1873, is one of
the most influential newspapers in the South. The charitable
institutions of the city include the Roper hospital, the Charleston
Orphan Asylum (founded in 1792), the William Euston
home for the aged, and a home for the widows of Confederate
soldiers.</p>

<p>In 1878 the United States government began the construction
of jetties to remove the bar at the entrance to Charleston harbour,
which was otherwise deep and spacious and well protected, and
by means of these jetties the bar has been so far removed as to
admit vessels drawing about 30 ft. of water. The result has been
not only the promotion of the city&rsquo;s commerce, but the removal
of the United States naval station and navy yard from Port
Royal to what was formerly Chicora Park on the left bank of the
Cooper river, a short distance above the city limits. The city&rsquo;s
commerce consists largely in the export of cotton,<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> rice, fertilizers,
fruits, lumber and naval stores; the value of its exports,
$10,794,000 in 1897, decreased to $2,196,596 in 1907 ($3,164,089
in 1908), while that of the import trade ($1,255,483 in 1897)
increased to $3,840,585 in 1907 ($3,323,844 in 1908). The
principal industries are the preparation of fertilizers&mdash;largely
from the extensive beds of phosphate rock along the banks of
the Ashley river and from cotton-seed meal&mdash;cotton compressing,
rice cleaning, canning oysters, fruits and vegetables, and the
manufacture of cotton bagging, of lumber, of cooperage goods,
clothing and carriages and wagons. Between 1880 and 1890
the industrial development of the city was very rapid, the
manufactures in 1890 showing an increase of 229.6% over those
of 1880; the increase between 1890 and 1900 was only 6.2%.
In 1900 the total value of the city&rsquo;s manufactures, 16.3%
(in value) of the product of the entire state, was $9,562,387, the
value of the fertilizer product alone, much the most important,
being $3,697,090.<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The first English settlement in South Carolina,
established at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley
river in 1670, was named Charles Town in honour of Charles II.
The location proving undesirable, a new Charles Town on the
site of the present city was begun about 1672, and the seat of
government was removed to it in 1680. The name Charles Town
became Charlestown about 1719 and Charleston in 1783. Among
the early settlers were English Churchmen, New England
Congregationalists, Scotch and Irish Presbyterians, Dutch and
German Lutherans, Huguenots (especially in 1680-1688) from
France and Switzerland, and a few Quakers; later the French
element of the population was augmented by settlers from
Acadia (1755) and from San Domingo (1793). Although it
soon became the largest and the wealthiest settlement south of
Philadelphia, Charleston did not receive a charter until 1783,
and did not have even a township government. Local ordinances
were passed by the provincial legislature and enforced
partly by provincial officials and partly by the church wardens.
It was, however, the political and social centre of the province,
being not only the headquarters of the governor, council and
colonial officials, but also the only place at which courts of
justice were held until the complaints of the Up Country people
led to the establishment of circuit courts in 1772. After the
American War of Independence it continued to be the capital
of South Carolina until 1790. The charter of 1783, though
frequently amended and altered, is still in force. By an act of
the state legislature passed in 1837 the terms &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; and
&ldquo;alderman&rdquo; superseded the older terms &ldquo;intendant&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wardens.&rdquo; The city was the heart of the nullification movement
of 1832-1833; and in St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, in Broad Street,
on the 20th of December 1860, a convention called by the state
legislature passed an ordinance of secession from the Union.</p>

<p>Charleston has several times been attacked by naval forces
and has suffered from many storms. Hurricane and epidemic
together devastated the town both in 1699 and in 1854; the
older and more thickly settled part of the town was burnt in
1740, and a hurricane did great damage in 1752. In 1706,
during the War of the Spanish Succession, a combined fleet of
Spanish and French under Captain Le Feboure was repulsed
by the forces of Governor Nathaniel Johnson (d. 1713) and
Colonel William Rhett (1666-1721). During the War of Independence
Charleston withstood the attack of Sir Peter Parker
and Sir Henry Clinton in 1776, and that of General Augustus
Prevost in 1779, but shortly afterwards became the objective
of a more formidable attack by Sir Henry Clinton, the
commander-in-chief of the British forces in America. In the
later years of the contest the British turned their attention to
the reduction of the colonies in the south, and the prominent
point and best base of operations in that section was the city
of Charleston, which was occupied in the latter part of 1779
by an American force under General Benjamin Lincoln. In
December of that year Sir Henry Clinton embarked from New
York with 8000 British troops and proceeded to invest Charleston
by land. He entrenched himself west of the city between the
Cooper and Ashley rivers, which bound it north and south, and
thus hemmed Lincoln in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>. The latter made the mistake
of attempting to defend the city with an inferior force.
Delays had occurred in the British operations and Clinton was
not prepared to summon the Americans to surrender until the
10th of April 1780. Lincoln refused, and Clinton advanced his
trenches to the third parallel, rendering his enemy&rsquo;s works
untenable. On the 12th of May Lincoln capitulated. About
2000 American Continentals were made prisoners, and an equal
number of militia and armed citizens. This success was regarded
by the British as an offset against the loss of Burgoyne&rsquo;s army
in 1777, and Charleston at once became the base of active
operations in the Carolinas, which Clinton left Cornwallis to
conduct. Thenceforward Charleston was under military rule
until evacuated by the British on the 14th of December 1782.</p>

<p>The bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter (garrisoned
by Federal troops) by the South Carolinians, on the 12th and
13th of April 1861, marked the actual beginning of the American
Civil War.  From 1862 onwards Charleston was more or less
under siege by the Federal naval and military forces until 1865.
The Confederates repulsed a naval attack made by the Federals
under Admiral S.F. Du Pont in April 1863, and a land attack
under General Q.A. Gillmore in June of the same year. They
were compelled to evacuate the city on the 17th of February
1865, after having burned a considerable amount of cotton and
other supplies to prevent them from falling into the hands of the
enemy. After the Civil War the wealth and the population
steadily increased, in spite of the destruction wrought by the
earthquake of 31st August 1886 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Earthquake</a></span>). In that
catastrophe 27 persons were killed, many more were injured
and died subsequently, 90% of the buildings were injured, and
property to the value of more than $5,000,000 was destroyed.
The South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page945" id="page945"></a>945</span>
here from the 1st of December 1901 to the 1st of June 1902,
called the attention of investors to the resources of the city and
state, but was not successful financially, and Congress appropriated
$160,000 to make good the deficit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLESTON,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> the capital of West Virginia, U.S.A., and the
county-seat of Kanawha county, situated near the centre of the
state, on the N. bank of the Kanawha river, at the mouth of
the Elk river, about 200 m. E. of Cincinnati, Ohio, and about
130 m. S.W. of Wheeling. Pop. (1890) 6742; (1900) 11,099,
of whom 1787 were negroes, and 353 were foreign-born; (1910
census) 22,996. It is served by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, the
Toledo &amp; Ohio Central, the Coal &amp; Coke, and the Kanawha &amp;
West Virginia (39 m. to Blakeley) railways, and by several river
transportation lines on the Kanawha river (navigable throughout
the year by means of movable locks) connecting with Ohio and
Mississippi river ports. The city is attractively built on high
level land, above the river; in addition to a fine customs house,
court house and high school, it contains the West Virginia state
capitol, erected in 1880. The libraries include the state law
library, with 14,000 volumes in 1908, and the library of the
state Department of Archives and History, with about 11,000
volumes. Charleston is in the midst of a region rich in bituminous
coal, the shipment of which by river and rail constitutes
one of its principal industries. Oil wells in the vicinity also
furnish an important product for export, and there are iron and
salt mines near. An ample supply of natural gas is utilized by
its manufacturing establishments; and among its manufactures
are axes, lumber, foundry and machine shop products, furniture,
boilers, woollen goods, glass and chemical fire-engines. The value
of the city&rsquo;s factory products increased from $1,261,815 in 1900
to $2,728,074 in 1905, or 116.2%, a greater rate of increase
than that of any other city (with 8000 or more inhabitants)
in the state during this period. The first permanent white
settlement at Charleston was made soon after the close of the
War of Independence; it was one of the places through which
the streams of immigrants entered the Ohio Valley, and it
became of considerable importance as a centre of transfer and
shipment, but it was not until the development of the coal-mining
region that it became industrially important. Charleston
was incorporated in 1794, and was chartered as a city in 1870.
Since the latter year it has been the seat of government of West
Virginia, with the exception of the decade 1875-1885, when
Wheeling was the capital.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLESTOWN,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> formerly a separate city of Middlesex
county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., but since 1874 a part of the city
of Boston, with which it had long before been in many respects
practically one. It is situated on a small peninsula on Boston
harbour, between the mouths of the Mystic and Charles rivers;
the first bridge across the Charles, built in 1786, connected
Charlestown and Boston. A United States navy yard (1800),
occupying about 87 acres, and the Massachusetts state prison
(1805) are here; the old burying-ground contains the grave of
John Harvard and that of Thomas Beecher, the first American
member of the famous Beecher family; and there is a soldiers&rsquo;
and sailors&rsquo; monument (1872), designed by Martin Milmore.
Charlestown was founded in 1628 or 1629, being the oldest part
of Boston, and soon rose into importance; it was organized
as a township in 1630, and was chartered as a city in 1847.
Within its limits was fought, on the 17th of June 1775, the battle
of Bunker Hill (<i>q.v.</i>), when Charlestown was almost completely
destroyed by the British. The Bunker Hill Monument commemorates
the battle; and the navy yard at Moulton&rsquo;s Point
was the landing-place of the attacking British troops. Little
was done toward the rebuilding of Charlestown until 1783.
The original territory of the township was very large, and from
parts of it were formed Woburn (1642), Malden (1649), Stoneham
(1725), and Somerville (1842); other parts were annexed to
Cambridge, to Medford and to Arlington. S.F.B. Morse, the
inventor of the electric telegraph, was born here; and Charlestown
was the birthplace and home of Nathaniel Gorham (1738-1796),
a member of the Continental Congress in 1782-1783 and
1785-1787, and its president in 1786; and was the home of
Loammi Baldwin (1780-1838), a well-known civil engineer; of
Samuel Dexter (1761-1816), an eminent lawyer, secretary of
war and for a short time secretary of the treasury in the cabinet
of President John Adams; and of Oliver Holden (1765-1831), a
composer of hymn-tunes, including &ldquo;Coronation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLET, NICOLAS TOUSSAINT<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (1792-1845), French designer
and painter, more especially of military subjects, was
born in Paris on the 20th of December 1792. He was the son of a
dragoon in the Republican army, whose death in the ranks left
the widow and orphan in very poor circumstances. Madame
Charlet, however, a woman of determined spirit and an extreme
Napoleonist, managed to give her boy a moderate education at
the Lycée Napoléon, and was repaid by his lifelong affection.
His first employment was in a Parisian mairie, where he had to
register recruits: he served in the National Guard in 1814,
fought bravely at the Barrière de Clichy, and, being thus unacceptable
to the Bourbon party, was dismissed from the mairie
in 1816. He then, having from a very early age had a propensity
for drawing, entered the atelier of the distinguished painter
Baron Gros, and soon began issuing the first of those lithographed
designs which eventually brought him renown. His &ldquo;Grenadier
de Waterloo,&rdquo; 1817, with the motto &ldquo;La Garde meurt et ne se
rend pas&rdquo; (a famous phrase frequently attributed to Cambronne,
but which he never uttered, and which cannot, perhaps, be traced
farther than to this lithograph by Charlet), was particularly
popular. It was only towards 1822, however, that he began to
be successful in a professional sense. Lithographs (about 2000
altogether), water-colours, sepia-drawings, numerous oil sketches,
and a few etchings followed one another rapidly; there were
also three exhibited oil pictures, the first of which was especially
admired&mdash;&ldquo;Episode in the Campaign of Russia&rdquo; (1836), the
&ldquo;Passage of the Rhine by Moreau&rdquo; (1837), &ldquo;Wounded Soldiers
Halting in a Ravine&rdquo; (1843). Besides the military subjects in
which he peculiarly delighted, and which found an energetic
response in the popular heart, and kept alive a feeling of regret
for the recent past of the French nation and discontent with
the present,&mdash;a feeling which increased upon the artist himself
towards the close of his career,&mdash;Charlet designed many subjects
of town life and peasant life, the ways of children, &amp;c., with much
wit and whim in the descriptive mottoes. One of the most
famous sets is the &ldquo;Vie civile, politique, et militaire du Caporal
Valentin,&rdquo; 50 lithographs, dating from 1838 to 1842. In 1838
his health began to fail owing to an affection of the chest. He
died in Paris on the 30th of October 1845. Charlet was an uncommonly
tall man, with an expressive face, bantering and good
natured; his character corresponded, full of boyish fun and
high spirits, with manly independence, and a vein of religious
feeling, and he was a hearty favourite among his intimates, one
of whom was the painter Géricault. Charlet married in 1824, and
two sons survived him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLEVILLE,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> a town of north-eastern France, in the
department of Ardennes, 151 m. N.E. of Paris on the Eastern
railway. Pop. (1906) 19,693. Charleville is situated within
a bend of the Meuse on its left bank, opposite Mézières, with
which it is united by a suspension bridge. The town was founded
in 1606 by Charles III. (Gonzaga), duke of Nevers, afterwards
duke of Mantua, and is laid out on a uniform plan. Its central
and most interesting portion is the Place Ducale, a large square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page946" id="page946"></a>946</span>
surrounded by old houses with high-pitched roofs, the porches
being arranged so as to form a continuous arcade; in the centre
there is a fountain surmounted by a statue of the duke Charles.
A handsome church in the Romanesque style and the other public
buildings date from the 19th century. An old mill, standing on
the bank of the river, dates from the early years of the
town&rsquo;s existence. On the right bank of the Meuse is Mont
Olympe, with the ruins of a fortress dismantled under Louis XIV.
Charleville, which shares with Mézières the administrative
institutions of the department of Ardennes, has tribunals of first
instance and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a board of
trade-arbitrators and lycées and training colleges for both sexes.
Its chief industries are metal-founding and the manufacture of
nails, anvils, tools and other iron goods, and brush-making;
leather-working and sugar-refining, and the making of bricks and
clay pipes are also carried on.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARLEVOIX, PIERRE FRANÇOIS XAVIER DE<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1682-1761),
French Jesuit traveller and historian, was born at St Quentin on
the 29th of October 1682. At the age of sixteen he entered the
Society of Jesus; and at the age of twenty-three was sent to
Canada, where he remained for four years as professor at Quebec.
He then returned and became professor of belles lettres at home,
and travelled on the errands of his society in various countries.
In 1720-1722, under orders from the regent, he visited America
for the second time, and went along the Great Lakes and down
the Mississippi. In later years (1733-1755) he was one of the
directors of the <i>Journal de Trévoux</i>. He died at La Flèche on
the 1st of February 1761. His works, enumerated in the <i>Bibliographie
des Prèrs de la Compagnie de Jesus</i> (by Carlos Sommervogel),
fall into two groups. The first contains his <i>Histoire de
l&rsquo;établissement, du progrès et de la décadence du Christianisme
dans l&rsquo;empire du Japon</i> (Rouen, 1715; English trans. <i>History
of the Church of Japan</i>, 1715), and his <i>Histoire et description
générale du Japon</i> (1736), a compilation chiefly from Kämpfer.
The second group includes his historical work on America:
<i>Histoire de l&rsquo;Isle Espagnole ou de Saint Domingue</i> (1730), based
on manuscript memoirs of P. Jean-Baptiste Le Pers and original
sources; <i>Histoire de Paraguay</i> (1756); <i>Vie de la Mère Marie
de l&rsquo;Incarnation, institutrice et première supérieure des Urselines
de la Nouvelle-France</i> (1724); <i>Histoire et description générale
de la Nouvelle-France</i> (1744; in English 1769; tr. J.G.

Michigan and Pine Lake, which are connected by Pine river and
Round Lake. Pop. (1890) 1496; (1900) 2079; (1904) 2395;
(1910) 2420. It is on the main line of the Père Marquette
railway, and during the summer season is served by lake steamers.
The village is best known as a summer resort; it is built on bluffs
and on a series of terraces rising from Round and Pine lakes and
affording extensive views; and there are a number of attractive
summer residences. Charlevoix is an important hardwood
lumber port, and the principal industries are the manufacture
of lumber and of cement; fishing (especially for lake trout and
white fish); the raising of sugar beets; and the manufacture
of rustic and fancy wood-work. Charlevoix was settled about
1866, and was incorporated as a village in 1879.</p>

Good Samaritan (Episcopal) for negroes, Mercy General (Roman
Catholic) and a Presbyterian. The city is the seat of Elizabeth
College and Conservatory of Music (1897), a non-sectarian
institution for women, of the Presbyterian College for women,
and of Biddle University (Presbyterian) for negroes, established
in 1867. There is a United States assay office, established as a
branch mint in 1837, during the days of North Carolina&rsquo;s great
importance as a gold producing state, and closed from 1861 to
1869. The city has large cotton, clothing, and knitting mills,
and manufactories of cotton-seed oil, tools, machinery, fertilizers
and furniture. The total value of its factory products was
$4,849,630 in 1905. There are large electric power plants in
and near the city. Printing and publishing are of some importance:
Charlotte is the publication headquarters of the
African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; and several textile
trade journals and two medical periodicals are published here.
The water-works are owned by the municipality. Charlotte
was settled about 1750 and was incorporated in 1768. Here
in May 1775 was adopted the &ldquo;Mecklenburg Declaration of
Independence&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">North Carolina</a></span>), and in honour of its
signers there is a monument in front of the court-house. Charlotte
was occupied in September 1780 by Cornwallis, who left it after

earlier name of the town was Lietzenburg. Pop. (1890) 76,859;
(1900) 189,290; (1905) 237,231. It is governed by a council
of 94 members. The central part of the town is connected with
Berlin by a magnificent avenue, the Charlottenburger Chaussee,
which runs from the Brandenburger Tor through the whole
length of the Tiergarten. Although retaining its own municipal
government, Charlottenburg, together with the adjacent suburban
towns of Schoneberg and Rixdorf, was included in 1900 in the
police district of the capital. The Schloss, built in 1696 for
the electress Sophie Charlotte, queen of the elector Frederick,
afterwards King Frederick I., after whom the town was named,
contains a collection of antiquities and paintings. In the
grounds stands a granite mausoleum, the work of Karl Friedrich
Schinkel, with beautiful white marble recumbent statues of
Frederick William III. and his queen Louise by Christian
Daniel Rauch, and also those of the emperor William I. and
the empress Augusta by Erdmann Encke. It was in the Schloss
that the emperor Frederick III. took over the reins of government
in 1888, and here he resided for nearly the whole of his
three months&rsquo; reign. The town contains an equestrian statue
of Frederick. Of public buildings, the famous technical academy
and the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church are referred to in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Berlin</a></span>. In Charlottenburg is the Physikalisch-technische
Reichsanstalt, a state institution for the carrying out of scientific
experiments and measurements, and for testing instruments of
precision, materials, &amp;c. It was established in 1886 with money
provided by Ernst Werner Siemens. In addition to the famous
royal porcelain manufactory, Charlottenburg has many flourishing
industries, notably iron-works grouped along the banks of
the Spree. Its main thoroughfares are laid out on a spacious
plan, while there are many quiet streets containing pretty villas.

region. Pop. (1890) 5591; (1900) 6449 (2613 being negroes);
(1910) 6765. The city is served by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, and the
Southern railways, and is best known as the seat of the University
of Virginia (<i>q.v.</i>), which was founded by Thomas Jefferson. Here
are also the Rawlings Institute for girls, founded as the Albemarle
Female Institute in 1857, and a University school. Monticello,
Jefferson&rsquo;s home, is still standing about 2 m. south-east of the
city on a fine hill, called Little Mountain until Jefferson Italianised
the name. The south pavilion of the present house is the
original brick building, one and a half storeys high, first occupied
by Jefferson in 1770. He was buried near the house, which was
sold by his daughter some years after his death. George Rogers
Clark was born near Monticello. Charlottesville is a trade
centre for the surrounding country; among its manufactures
are woollen goods, overalls, agricultural implements and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page947" id="page947"></a>947</span>
cigars and tobacco. The city owns its water-supply system
and owns and operates its gas plant; an electric plant, privately
owned, lights the streets and many houses. The site of the city
was a part of the Castle Hill estate of Thomas Walker (1715-1794),
an intimate friend of George Washington. The act
establishing the town of Charlottesville was passed by the
Assembly of Virginia in November 1762, when the name Charlottesville
(in honour of Queen Charlotte, wife of George III.) first
appeared. In 1779-1780 about 4000 of Burgoyne&rsquo;s troops,
surrendered under the &ldquo;Convention&rdquo; of Saratoga, were
quartered here; in October 1780 part of them were sent to
Lancaster, Pa., and later the rest were sent north. In June
1781 Tarleton raided Charlottesville and the vicinity, nearly
captured Thomas Jefferson, and destroyed the public records
and some arms and ammunition. In 1888 Charlottesville was
chartered as a city administratively independent of the county.</p>

traveller and archaeologist, was born in Fleurie (Rhône), on the
2nd of May 1828. He studied at the Lycée Charlemagne, in
1850 became a teacher in New Orleans, Louisiana, and there
became acquainted with John Lloyd Stephens&rsquo;s books of travel
in Yucatan. He travelled in Mexico, under a commission from
the French ministry of education, in 1857-1861; in Madagascar
in 1863; in South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, in
1875; and in Java and Australia in 1878. In 1880-1883 he
again visited the ruined cities of Mexico. Pierre Lorillard of
New York contributed to defray the expense of this expedition,
and Charnay named a great ruined city near the Guatemalan
boundary line Ville Lorillard in his honour. Charnay went to
Yucatan in 1886. The more important of his publications are

Cortez&rsquo;s letters into French, under the title <i>Lettres de Fernand
Cortes à Charles-quint sur la découverte et la conquête du Mexique</i>

<p><span class="bold">CHARNOCK, JOB<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> (d. 1693), English founder of Calcutta,
went out to India in 1655 or 1656, apparently not in the East
India Company&rsquo;s service, but soon joined it. He was stationed
at Cossimbazar, and subsequently at Patna. In 1685 he became
chief agent at Hugli. Being besieged there by the Mogul viceroy
of Bengal, he put the company&rsquo;s goods and servants on board
his light vessels and dropped down the river 27 m. to the village
of Sutanati, a place well chosen for the purpose of defence, which
occupied the site of what is now Calcutta. It was only, however,
at the third attempt that Charnock finally settled down at this
spot, and the selection of the future capital of India was entirely
due to his stubborn resolution. He was a silent morose man, not
popular among his contemporaries, but &ldquo;always a faithfull Man
to the Company.&rdquo; He is said to have married a Hindu widow.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARNOCK<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Chernock</span>), <span class="bold">ROBERT</span> (c.1663-1696), English
conspirator, belonged to a Warwickshire family, and was educated
at Magdalen College, Oxford, becoming a fellow of his
college and a Roman Catholic priest. When in 1687 the dispute
arose between James II. and the fellows of Magdalen over the
election of a president Charnock favoured the first royal nominee,
Anthony Farmer, and also the succeeding one, Samuel Parker,
bishop of Oxford. Almost alone among the fellows he was not
driven out in November 1687, and he became dean and then
vice-president of the college under the new regime, but was
expelled in October 1688. Residing at the court of the Stuarts
in France, or conspiring in England, Charnock and Sir George
Barclay appear to have arranged the details of the unsuccessful
attempt to kill William III. near Turnham Green in February
1696, Barclay escaped, but Charnock was arrested, was tried
and found guilty, and was hanged on the 18th of March 1696.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARNOCKITE,<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span> a series of foliated igneous rocks of wide
distribution and great importance in India, Ceylon, Madagascar
and Africa. The name was given by Dr T.H. Holland from the
fact that the tombstone of Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta,
is made of a block of this rock. The charnockite series includes
rocks of many different types, some being acid and rich in quartz
and microcline, others basic and full of pyroxene and olivine, while
there are also intermediate varieties corresponding mineralogically
to norites, quartz-norites and diorites. A special
feature, recurring in many members of the group, is the presence
of strongly pleochroic, reddish or green hypersthene. Many of
the minerals of these rocks are &ldquo;schillerized,&rdquo; as they contain
minute platy or rod-shaped enclosures, disposed parallel to
certain crystallographic planes or axes. The reflection of light
from the surfaces of these enclosures gives the minerals often
a peculiar appearance, <i>e.g.</i> the quartz is blue and opalescent, the
felspar has a milky shimmer like moonshine, the hypersthene has
a bronzy metalloidal gleam. Very often the different rock types
occur in close association as one set forms bands alternating with
another set, or veins traversing it, and where one facies appears the
others also usually are found. The term charnockite consequently
is not the name of a rock, but of an assemblage of rock
types, connected in their origin because arising by differentiation
of the same parent magma. The banded structure which these
rocks commonly present in the field is only in a small measure due
to crushing, but is to a large extent original, and has been produced
by fluxion in a viscous crystallizing intrusive magma, together
with differentiation or segregation of the mass into bands of different
chemical and mineralogical composition. There have also
been, of course, earth movements acting on the solid rock at a
later time and injection of dikes both parallel to and across the
primary foliation. In fact, the history of the structures of the
charnockite series is the history of the most primitive gneisses
in all parts of the world, for which we cannot pretend to have
as yet any thoroughly satisfactory explanations to offer. A
striking fact is the very wide distribution of rocks of this group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page948" id="page948"></a>948</span>
in the southern hemisphere; but they also, or rocks very similar
to them, occur in Norway, France, Germany, Scotland and
North America, though in these countries they have been mostly
described as pyroxene granulites, pyroxene gneisses, anorthosites,
&amp;c. They are usually regarded as being of Archean age (pre-Cambrian),
and in most cases this can be definitely proved,
though not in all. It is astonishing to find that in spite of their
great age their minerals are often in excellent preservation. In
India they form the Nilgiri Hills, the Shevaroys and part of the
Western Ghats, extending southward to Cape Comorin and reappearing
in Ceylon. Although they are certainly for the most
part igneous gneisses (or orthogneisses), rocks occur along with
them, such as marbles, scapolite limestones, and corundum rocks,
which were probably of sedimentary origin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAROLLES,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> a town of east-central France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Saône-et-Loire, situated
at the confluence of the Semence and the Arconce, 39 m. W.N.W.
of Mâcon on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906) 3228. It has
a sub-prefecture, tribunals of primary instance and commerce,
and a communal college. There are stone quarries in the vicinity;
the town manufactures pottery, and is the centre for trade in the
famous breed of Charolais cattle and in agricultural products.
The ruins of the castle of the counts of Charolais occupy the
summit of a hill in the immediate vicinity of the town. Charolles
was the capital of Charolais, an old division of France, which
from the early 14th century gave the title of count to its possessors.
In 1327 the countship passed by marriage to the house of
Armagnac, and in 1390 it was sold to Philip of Burgundy. After
the death of Charles the Bold, who in his youth had borne the
title of count of Charolais, it was seized by Louis XI. of France,
but in 1493 it was ceded by Charles VIII. to Maximilian of
Austria, the representative of the Burgundian family. Ultimately
passing to the Spanish kings, it became for a considerable
period an object of dispute between France and Spain, until at
length in 1684 it was assigned to the great Condé, a creditor of
the king of Spain. It was united to the French crown in 1771.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARON,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> in Greek mythology, the son of Erebus and Nyx
(Night). It was his duty to ferry over the Styx (or Acheron)
those souls of the deceased who had duly received the rites of
burial, in payment for which service he received an obol, which
was placed in the mouth of the corpse. It was only exceptionally
that he carried living passengers (<i>Aeneid</i>, vi. 295 ff). As
ferryman of the dead he is not mentioned in Homer or Hesiod,
and in this character is probably of Egyptian origin. He is
represented as a morose and grisly old man in a black sailor&rsquo;s
cape. By the Etruscans he was also supposed to be a kind of
executioner of the powers of the nether world, who, armed with
an enormous hammer, was associated with Mars in the slaughter
of battle. Finally he came to be regarded as the image of death
and the world below. As such he survives in the Charos or
Charontas of the modern Greeks&mdash;a black bird which darts down
upon its prey, or a winged horseman who fastens his victims to
the saddle and bears them away to the realms of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARONDAS,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a celebrated lawgiver of Catina in Sicily.
His date is uncertain. Some make him a pupil of Pythagoras
(c. 580-504 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); but all that can be said is that he was earlier
than Anaxilaus of Rhegium (494-476), since his laws were in
use amongst the Rhegians until they were abolished by that
tyrant. His laws, originally written in verse, were adopted by
the other Chalcidic colonies in Sicily and Italy. According to
Aristotle there was nothing special about these laws, except
that Charondas introduced actions for perjury; but he speaks
highly of the precision with which they were drawn up (<i>Politics,
</i> ii. 12). The story that Charondas killed himself because he
entered the public assembly wearing a sword, which was a
violation of his own law, is also told of Diocles and Zaleucus
(Diod. Sic. xii. 11-19). The fragments of laws attributed to him

<p><span class="bold">CHARPENTIER, FRANÇOIS<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1620-1702), French archaeologist
and man of letters, was born in Paris on the 15th of
February 1620. He was intended for the bar, but was employed
by Colbert, who had determined on the foundation of a French
East India Company, to draw up an explanatory account of the
project for Louis XIV. Charpentier regarded as absurd the use
of Latin in monumental inscriptions, and to him was entrusted
the task of supplying the paintings of Lebrun in the Versailles
Gallery with appropriate legends. His verses were so indifferent
that they had to be replaced by others, the work of Racine and
Boileau, both enemies of his. Charpentier in his <i>Excellence de la
langue française</i> (1683) had anticipated Perrault in the famous
academical dispute concerning the relative merit of the ancients
and moderns. He is credited with a share in the production of
the magnificent series of medals that commemorate the principal
events of the age of Louis XIV. Charpentier, who was
long in receipt of a pension of 1200 livres from Colbert, was
erudite and ingenious, but he was always heavy and commonplace.
His other works include a <i>Vie de Socrate</i> (1650), a translation
of the <i>Cyropaedia</i> of Xenophon (1658), and the <i>Traité de
la peinture parlante</i> (1684).</p>

simple and attractive picture of French manners. This, with

<p><span class="bold">CHARRON, PIERRE<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1541-1603), French philosopher, born
in Paris, was one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller.
After studying law he practised at Paris as an advocate, but,
having met with no great success, entered the church, and soon
gained the highest popularity as a preacher, rising to the dignity
of canon, and being appointed preacher in ordinary to Marguerite,
wife of Henry IV. of Navarre. About 1588, he determined to
fulfil a vow which he had once made to enter a cloister; but
being rejected by the Carthusians and the Celestines, he held
himself absolved, and continued to follow his old profession.
He delivered a course of sermons at Angers, and in the next year
passed to Bordeaux, where he formed a famous friendship with
Montaigne. At the death of Montaigne, in 1592, Charron was
requested in his will to bear the Montaigne arms.</p>

<p>In 1594 Charron published (at first anonymously, afterwards
under the name of &ldquo;Benoit Vaillant, Advocate of the Holy
Faith,&rdquo; and also, in 1594, in his own name) <i>Les Trois Verités</i>, in
which by methodical and orthodox arguments, he seeks to prove
that there is a God and a true religion, that the true religion is
the Christian, and that the true church is the Roman Catholic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page949" id="page949"></a>949</span>
The last book (which is three-fourths of the whole work) is
chiefly an answer to the famous Protestant work entitled <i>Le
Traité de l&rsquo;Église</i> by Du Plessis Mornay; and in the second
edition (1595) there is an elaborate reply to an attack made on
the third <i>Vérité</i> by a Protestant writer. <i>Les Trois Vérités</i> ran
through several editions, and obtained for its author the favour
of the bishop of Cahors, who appointed him grand vicar and
theological canon. It also led to his being chosen deputy to the
general assembly of the clergy, of which body he became chief
secretary. It was followed in 1600 by <i>Discours chrestiens</i>, a
book of sermons, similar in tone, half of which treat of the
Eucharist. In 1601 Charron published at Bordeaux his third
and most remarkable work&mdash;the famous <i>De la sagesse</i>, a complete
popular system of moral philosophy. Usually, and so far
correctly, it is coupled with the Essays of Montaigne, to which
the author is under very extensive obligations. There is, however,
distinct individuality in the book. It is specially interesting
from the time when it appeared, and the man by whom it was
written. Conspicuous as a champion of orthodoxy against
atheists, Jews and Protestants&mdash;without resigning this position,
and still upholding practical orthodoxy&mdash;Charron suddenly
stood forth as the representative of the most complete intellectual
scepticism. The <i>De la sagesse</i>, which represented a considerable
advance on the standpoint of the <i>Trois Vérités</i>, brought upon its
author the most violent attacks, the chief being by the Jesuit
François Garasse (1585-1631), who described him as a &ldquo;brutal
atheist.&rdquo; It received, however, the warm support of Henry IV.
and of the president Pierre Jeannin (1540-1622). A second
edition was soon called for. In 1603, notwithstanding much
opposition, it began to appear; but only a few pages had been
printed when Charron died suddenly in the street of apoplexy.
His death was regarded as a judgment for his impiety.</p>

<p>Charron&rsquo;s psychology is sensationalist. With sense all our
knowledge commences, and into sense all may be resolved.
The soul, located in the ventricles of the brain, is affected by the
temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces
acute intelligence; the moist, memory; the hot, imagination.
Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties, he shows&mdash;after
the manner which Francis Bacon subsequently adopted&mdash;what
branches of science correspond with each. With regard
to the nature of the soul he merely quotes opinions. The
belief in its immortality, he says, is the most universal of beliefs,
but the most feebly supported by reason. As to man&rsquo;s power
of attaining truth his scepticism is decided; and he plainly
declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish
truth from error. In comparing man with the lower animals,
Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. The latter
have reason; nay, they have virtue; and, though inferior in
some respects, in others they are superior. The estimate formed
of man is not, indeed, flattering. His most essential qualities
are vanity, weakness, inconstancy, presumption. Upon this
view of human nature and the human lot Charron founds his
moral system. Equally sceptical with Montaigne, and decidedly
more cynical, he is distinguished by a deeper and sterner tone.
Man comes into the world to endure; let him endure then, and
that in silence. Our compassion should be like that of
God, who succours the suffering without sharing in their pain.
Avoid vulgar errors; cherish universal sympathy. Let no passion
or attachment become too powerful for restraint. Follow
the customs and laws which surround you. Morality has no
connexion with religion. Reason is the ultimate criterion.</p>

<p>Special interest attaches to Charron&rsquo;s treatment of religion.
He insists on the diversities in religions; he dwells also on what
would indicate a common origin. All grow from small beginnings
and increase by a sort of popular contagion; all teach that God
is to be appeased by prayers, presents, vows, but especially, and
most irrationally, by human suffering. Each is said by its
devotees to have been given by inspiration. In fact, however,
a man is a Christian, Jew, or Mahommedan, before he knows he
is a man. One religion is built upon another. But while he
openly declares religion to be &ldquo;strange to common sense,&rdquo;
the practical result at which Charron arrives is that one is not
to sit in judgment on his faith, but to be &ldquo;simple and obedient,&rdquo;
and to allow himself to be led by public authority. This is one
rule of wisdom with regard to religion; and another equally
important is to avoid superstition, which he boldly defines as
the belief that God is like a hard judge who, eager to find fault,
narrowly examines our slightest act, that He is revengeful and
hard to appease, and that therefore He must be flattered and
importuned, and won over by pain and sacrifice. True piety,
which is the first of duties, is, on the other hand, the knowledge
of God and of one&rsquo;s self, the latter knowledge being necessary
to the former. It is the abasing of man, the exalting of God,&mdash;the
belief that what He sends is all good, and that all the bad is
from ourselves. It leads to spiritual worship; for external
ceremony is merely for our advantage, not for His glory. Charron
is thus the founder of modern secularism. His political views
are neither original nor independent. He pours much hackneyed
scorn on the common herd, declares the sovereign to be the
source of law, and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous.</p>

<p>A summary and defence of the <i>Sagesse</i>, written shortly before his
death, appeared in 1606. In 1604 his friend Michel de la Rochemaillet
prefixed to an edition of the <i>Sagesse</i> a Life, which depicts
Charron as a most amiable man of purest character. His complete
works, with this Life, were published in 1635. An excellent
abridgment of the <i>Sagesse</i> is given in Tennemann&rsquo;s <i>Philosophie</i>,

<p><span class="bold">CHART<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>carta, charta,</i> a map). A chart is a marine
map intended specially for the use of seamen (for history, see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Map</a></span>), though the word is also used loosely for other varieties
of graphical representation. The marine or nautical chart is
constructed for the purpose of ascertaining the position of a
ship with reference to the land, of finding the direction in which
she has to steer, the distance to sail or steam, and the hidden
dangers to avoid. The surface of the sea on charts is studded
with numerous small figures. These are known as the <i>soundings</i>,
indicating in fathoms or in feet (as shown upon the title of the
chart), at low water of ordinary spring tides, the least depth of
water through which the ship may be sailing. Charts show the
nature of the unseen bottom of the sea&mdash;with the irregularities
in its character in the shape of hidden rocks or sand-banks, and
give information of the greatest importance to the mariner.
No matter how well the land maybe surveyed or finely delineated,
unless the soundings are shown a chart is of little use.</p>

<p>The British admiralty charts are compiled, drawn and issued
by the hydrographic office. This department of the admiralty
was established under Earl Spencer by an order in council in
1795, consisting of the hydrographer, one assistant and a
draughtsman. The first hydrographer was Alexander Dalrymple,
a gentleman in the East India Company&rsquo;s civil service. From
this small beginning arose the important department which is
now the main source of the supply of hydrographical information
to the whole of the maritime world. The charts prepared by the
officers and draughtsmen of the hydrographic office, and published
by order of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, are
compiled chiefly from the labours of British naval officers employed
in the surveying service; and also from valuable contributions
received from time to time from officers of the royal
navy and mercantile marine. In addition to the work of British
sailors, the labours of other nations have been collected and
utilized. Charts of the coasts of Europe have naturally been
taken from the surveys made by the various nations, and in
charts of other quarters of the world considerable assistance has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page950" id="page950"></a>950</span>
been received from the labours of French, Spanish, Dutch and
American surveyors. Important work is done by the Hydrographic
Office of the American navy, and the U.S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey. The admiralty charts are published with
the view of meeting the wants of the sailor in all parts of the
world. They may be classed under five heads, viz. ocean, general,
and coast charts, harbour plans and physical charts; for
instance, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, approaches to
Plymouth, Plymouth Sound and wind and current charts. The
harbour plans and coast sheets are constructed on the simple
principles of plane trigonometry by the surveying officers. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Surveying</a></span>: <i>Nautical</i>.) That important feature, the depth of
the sea, is obtained by the ordinary sounding line or wire; all
soundings are reduced to low water of ordinary spring tides.
The times and heights of the tides, with the direction and velocity
of the tidal streams, are also ascertained. These MS. charts
are forwarded to the admiralty, and form the foundation of the
hydrography of the world. The ocean and general charts are
compiled and drawn at the hydrographic office, and as originals,
existing charts, latest surveys and maps, have to be consulted,
their compilation requires considerable experience and is a painstaking
work, for the compiler has to decide what to omit, what
to insert, and to arrange the necessary names in such a manner
that while full information is given, the features of the coast are
not interfered with. As a very slight error in the position of a
light or buoy, dot, cross or figure, might lead to grave disaster,
every symbol on the admiralty chart has been delineated with
great care and consideration, and no pains are spared in the
effort to lay before the public the labours of the nautical surveyors
and explorers not only of England, but of the maritime world;
reducing their various styles into a comprehensive system
furnishing the intelligent seaman with an intelligible guide,
which common industry will soon enable him to appreciate and
take full advantage of.</p>

<p>As certain abbreviations are used in the charts, attention is
called to the &ldquo;signs and abbreviations adopted in the charts
published by the admiralty.&rdquo; Certain parts of the world are still
unsurveyed, or not surveyed in sufficient detail for the requirements
that steamships now demand. Charts of these localities
are therefore drawn in a light hair-line and unfinished manner, so
that the experienced seaman sees at a glance that less trust is to
be reposed upon charts drawn in this manner. The charts given
to the public are only correct up to the time of their actual
publication. They have to be kept up to date. Recent publications
by foreign governments, newly reported dangers, changes
in character or position of lights and buoys, are as soon as
practicable inserted on the charts and due notice given of
such insertions in the admiralty &ldquo;Notices to Mariners.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The charts are supplemented by the <i>Admiralty Pilots</i>, or books
of sailing directions, with tide tables, and lists of lighthouses, light
vessels, &amp;c., for the coasts to which a ship may be bound. The
physical charts are the continuation of the work so ably begun by
Maury of the United States and FitzRoy of the British navy,
and give the sailor a good general idea of the world&rsquo;s ocean winds
and currents at the different periods of the year; the probable
tracks and seasons of the tropical revolving or cyclonic storms; the
coastal winds; the extent or months of the rainy seasons; localities
and times where ice may be fallen in with; and, lastly, the direction
and force of the stream and drift currents of the oceans. </p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARTER<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (Lat. <i>charta, carta,</i> from Gr. <span class="grk" title="chartês">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, originally for
<i>papyrus</i>, material for writing, thence transferred to paper and
from this material to the document, in O. Eng. <i>boc</i>, book), a
written instrument, contract or convention by which cessions
of sales of property or of rights and privileges are confirmed and
held, and which may be produced by the grantees in proof of
lawful possession. The use of the word for any written document
is obsolete in England, but is preserved in France, <i>e.g.</i> the
École des Chartes at Paris. In feudal times charters of privileges
were granted, not only by the crown, but by mesne lords both
lay and ecclesiastical, as well to communities, such as boroughs,
gilds and religious foundations, as to individuals. In modern
usage grants by charter have become all but obsolete, though in
England this form is still used in the incorporation by the crown
of such societies as the British Academy.</p>

<p>The grant of the Great Charter by King John in 1215 (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Magna Carta</a></span>), which guaranteed the preservation of English
liberties, led to a special association of the word with
constitutional privileges, and so in modern times it has been
applied to constitutions granted by sovereigns to their subjects, in
contradistinction to those based on &ldquo;the will of the people.&rdquo;
Such was the Charter (<i>Charte</i>) granted by Louis XVIII. to
France in 1814. In Portugal the constitution granted by Dom
Pedro in 1826 was called by the French party the &ldquo;Charter,&rdquo;
while that devised by the Cortes in 1821 was known as the
&ldquo;Constitution.&rdquo; Magna Carta also suggested to the English
radicals in 1838 the name &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Charter,&rdquo; which they gave
to their published programme of reforms (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chartism</a></span>). This
association of the idea of liberty with the word charter led to its
figurative use in the sense of freedom or licence. This is,
however, rare; the most common use being in the phrase &ldquo;chartered
libertine&rdquo; (Shakespeare, <i>Henry V.</i> Act i. Sc. 1) from the
derivative verb &ldquo;to charter,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> to grant a charter. The common
colloquialism &ldquo;to charter,&rdquo; in the sense of to take, or hire, is
derived from the special use of &ldquo;to charter&rdquo; as to hire (a ship)
by charter-party.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARTERED COMPANIES.<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> A chartered company is a
trading corporation enjoying certain rights and privileges, and
bound by certain obligations under a special charter granted to
it by the sovereign authority of the state, such charter defining
and limiting those rights, privileges and obligations, and the
localities in which they are to be exercised. Such companies
existed in early times, but have undergone changes and
modifications in accordance with the developments which have taken
place in the economic history of the states where they have
existed. In Great Britain the first trading charters were granted,
not to English companies, which were then non-existent, but
to branches of the Hanseatic League (<i>q.v.</i>), and it was not till
1597 that England was finally relieved from the presence of a
foreign chartered company. In that year Queen Elizabeth closed
the steel-yard where Teutons had been established for 700 years.</p>

<p>The origin of all English trading companies is to be sought
in the Merchants of the Staple. They lingered on into the 18th
century, but only as a name, for their business was solely to
export English products which, as English manufactures grew,
were wanted at home. Of all early English chartered companies,
the &ldquo;Merchant Adventurers&rdquo; conducted its operations the most
widely. Itself a development of very early trading gilds, at the
height of its prosperity it employed as many as 50,000 persons in
the Netherlands, and the enormous influence it was able to
exercise undoubtedly saved Antwerp from the institution of the
Inquisition within its walls in the time of Charles V. In the reign
of Elizabeth British trade with the Netherlands reached in one
year 12,000,000 ducats, and in that of James I. the company&rsquo;s
yearly commerce with Germany and the Netherlands was as much
as £1,000,000. Hamburg afterwards was its principal depot, and
it became known as the &ldquo;Hamburg Company.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Merchant
Adventurers&rsquo;&rdquo; enterprises is to be seen the germ of the
trading companies which had so remarkable a development in the
16th and 17th centuries. These old regulated trade gilds passed
gradually into joint-stock associations, which were capable of far
greater extension, both as to the number of members and amount
of stock, each member being only accountable for the amount of
his own stock, and being able to transfer it at will to any other
person.</p>

<p>It was in the age of Elizabeth and the early Stuarts that
the chartered company, in the modern sense of the term, had
its rise. The discovery of the New World, and the opening out
of fresh trading routes to the Indies, gave an extraordinary
impulse to shipping, commerce and industrial enterprise throughout
western Europe. The English, French and Dutch governments
were ready to assist trade by the granting of charters to
trading associations. It is to the &ldquo;Russia Company,&rdquo; which
received its first charter in 1554, that Great Britain owed its
first intercourse with an empire then almost unknown. The
first recorded instance of a purely chartered company annexing
territory is to be found in the action of this company in setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page951" id="page951"></a>951</span>
up a cross at Spitzbergen in 1613 with King James&rsquo;s arms upon it.
Among other associations trading to the continent of Europe,
receiving charters at this time, were the Turkey Company
(Levant Co.) and the Eastland Company. Both the Russia
and Turkey Companies had an important effect upon British
relations with those empires. They maintained British influence
in those countries, and even paid the expenses of the embassies
which were sent out by the English government to their courts.
The Russia Company carried on a large trade with Persia through
Russian territory; but from various causes their business
gradually declined, though the Turkey Company existed in
name until 1825.</p>

<p>The chartered companies which were formed during this period
for trade with the Indies and the New World have had a more
wide-reaching influence in history. The extraordinary career
of the East India Company (<i>q.v.</i>) is dealt with elsewhere.</p>

<p>Charters were given to companies trading to Guinea, Morocco,
Guiana and the Canaries, but none of these enjoyed a very long
or prosperous existence, principally owing to the difficulties
caused by foreign competition. It is when we turn to North
America that the importance of the chartered company, as a
colonizing rather than a trading agency, is seen in its full
development. The &ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,&rdquo; which still exists as a
commercial concern, is dealt with under its own heading, but
most of the thirteen British North American colonies were in
their inception chartered companies very much in the modern
acceptation of the term. The history of these companies will
be found under the heading of the different colonies of which
they were the origin. It is necessary, however, to bear in mind
that two classes of charters are to be found in force among the
early American colonies: (1) Those granted to trading associations,
which were often useful when the colony was first founded,
but which formed a serious obstacle to its progress when the
country had become settled and was looking forward to
commercial expansion; the existence of these charters then often
led to serious conflicts between the grantees of the charter and
the colonies; ultimately elective assemblies everywhere
superseded control of trading companies. (2) The second class of
charters were those granted to the settlers themselves, to protect
them against the oppressions of the crown and the provincial
governors. These were highly prized by the colonists.</p>

<p>In France and Holland, no less than in England, the institution
of chartered companies became a settled principle of the
governments of those countries during the whole of the period in
question. In France from 1599 to 1789, more than 70 of such
companies came into existence, but after 1770, when the great
<i>Compagnie des Indes orientales</i> went into liquidation, they were
almost abandoned, and finally perished in the general sweeping
away of privileges which followed on the outbreak of the Revolution.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the economic ideas which induced the
granting of charters to these earlier companies and animated
their promoters, we shall find that they were entirely consistent
with the general principles of government at the time and what
were then held to be sound commercial views. Under the old
régime everything was a matter of monopoly and privilege, and
to this state of things the constitution of the old companies
corresponded, the sovereign rights accorded to them being also
quite in accordance with the views of the time. It would have
been thought impossible then that private individuals could
have found the funds or maintained the magnitude of such
enterprises. It was only this necessity which induced statesmen
like Colbert to countenance them, and Montesquieu took the
same view (<i>Esprit des lois</i>, t. xx. c. 10). John de Witt&rsquo;s view
was that such companies were not useful for colonization properly
so called, because they want quick returns to pay their dividends.
So, even in France and Holland, opinion was by no means
settled as to their utility. In England historic protests were
made against such monopolies, but the chartered companies
were less exclusive in England than in either France or Holland,
the governors of provinces almost always allowing strangers to
trade on receiving some pecuniary inducement. French commercial
companies were more privileged, exclusive and artificial
than those in Holland and England. Those of Holland may be
said to have been national enterprises. French companies
rested more than did their rivals on false principles; they were
more fettered by the royal power, and had less initiative of their
own, and therefore had less chance of surviving. As an example
of the kind of rules which prevented the growth of the French
companies, it may be pointed out that no Protestants were
allowed to take part in them. State subventions, rather than
commerce or colonization, were often their object; but that has
been a characteristic of French colonial enterprise at all times.</p>

<p>Such companies, however, under the old commercial system
could hardly have come into existence without exclusive privileges.
Their existence might have been prolonged had the
whole people in time been allowed the chance of participating
in them.</p>

<p>To sum up the causes of failure of the old chartered companies,
they are to be attributed to (1) bad administration; (2) want
of capital and credit; (3) bad economic organization; (4)
distribution of dividends made prematurely or fictitiously.
But those survived the longest which extended the most widely
their privileges to outsiders. According to contemporary protests,
they had a most injurious effect on the commerce of the
countries where they had their rise. They were monopolies,
and therefore, of course, obnoxious; and it is undoubted that
the colonies they founded only became prosperous when they
had escaped from their yoke.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that they contributed
in no small degree to the commercial progress of their
own states. They gave colonies to the mother country, and an
impulse to the development of its fleet. In the case of England
and Holland, the enterprise of the companies saved them from
suffering from the monopolies of Spain and Portugal, and the wars
of the English, and those of the Dutch in the Indies with Spain
and Portugal, were paid for by the companies. They furnished
the mother country with luxuries which, by the 18th century,
had become necessaries. They offered a career for the younger
sons of good families, and sometimes greatly assisted large and
useful enterprises.</p>

<p>During the last twenty years of the 19th century there was a
great revival of the system of chartered companies in Great
Britain. It is a feature of the general growth of interest in
colonial expansion and commercial development which has
made itself felt almost universally among European nations.
Great Britain, however, alone has succeeded in establishing
such companies as have materially contributed to the growth
of her empire. These companies succeed or fail for reasons
different from those which affected the chartered companies
of former days, though there are points in common. Apart
from causes inherent in the particular case of each company,
which necessitates their being examined separately, recent
experience leads us to lay down certain general principles
regarding them. The modern companies are not like those of
the 16th and 17th centuries. They are not privileged in the
sense that those companies were. They are not monopolists;
they have only a limited sovereignty, always being subject to
the control of the home government. It is true that they have
certain advantages given them, for without these advantages
no capital would risk itself in the lands where they carry on their
operations. They often have very heavy corresponding obligations,
as will be seen in the case of one (the East Africa) where
the obligations were too onerous for the company to discharge,
though they were inseparable from its position. The charters
of modern companies differ in two points strongly from those of
the old: they contain clauses prohibiting any monopoly of
trade, and they generally confer some special political rights
directly under the control of the secretary of state. The political
freedom of the old companies was much greater. In these
charters state control has been made a distinguishing feature.
It is to be exercised in almost all directions in which the companies
may come into contact with matters political. Of course, it is
inevitable in all disputes of the companies with foreign powers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page952" id="page952"></a>952</span>
and is extended over all decrees of the company regarding the
administration of its territories, the taxation of natives, and
mining regulations. In all cases of dispute between the companies
and the natives the secretary of state is <i>ex officio</i> the
judge, and to the secretary of state (in the case of the South
Africa Company) the accounts of administration have to be
submitted for his approbation. It is deserving of notice that the
British character of the company is insisted upon in each case
in the charter which calls it into life. The crown always retains
complete control over the company by reserving to itself the
power of revoking the charter in case of the neglect of its stipulations.
Special clauses were inserted in the charters of the British
East Africa and South Africa Companies enabling the government
to forfeit their charters if they did not promote the objects
alleged as reasons for demanding a charter. This bound them
still more strongly; and in the case of the South Africa Company
the duration of the charter was fixed at twenty-five years.</p>

<p>The chartered company of these days is therefore very strongly
fixed within limits imposed by law on its political action. As a
whole, however, very remarkable results have been achieved.
This may be attributed in no small degree to the personality of
the men who have had the supreme direction at home and abroad,
and who have, by their social position and personal qualities,
acquired the confidence of the public. With the exception of the
Royal Niger Company, it would be incorrect to say that they
have been financially successful, but in the domain of government
generally it may be said that they have added vast territories to
the British empire (in Africa about 1,700,000 sq. m.), and in these
territories they have acted as a civilizing force. They have made
roads, opened facilities for trade, enforced peace, and laid at all
events the foundation of settled administration. It is not too
much to say that they have often acted unselfishly for the benefit
of the mother country and even humanity. We may instance the
anti-slavery and anti-alcohol campaigns which have been carried
on, the latter certainly being against the immediate pecuniary
interests of the companies themselves. It must, of course, be
recognized that to a certain extent this has been done under the
influence of the home government. The occupation of Uganda
certainly, and of the Nigerian territory and Rhodesia probably,
will prove to have been rather for the benefit of posterity
than of the companies which effected it. In the two cases where
the companies have been bought out by the state, they
have had no compensation for much that they have expended.
In fact, it would have been impossible to take into account
actual expenditure day by day, and the cost of wars. To use the
expression of Sir William Mackinnon, the shareholders have
been compelled in some cases to &ldquo;take out their dividends in
philanthropy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The existence of such companies to-day is justified in certain
political and economic conditions only. It may be highly desirable
for the government to occupy certain territories, but political
exigencies at home will not permit it to incur the expenditure, or
international relations may make such an undertaking inexpedient
at the time. In such a case the formation of a chartered
company may be the best way out of the difficulty. But it has
been demonstrated again and again that, directly, the company&rsquo;s
interests begin to clash with those of foreign powers, the home
government must assume a protectorate over its territories in
order to simplify the situation and save perhaps disastrous
collisions. So long as the political relations of such a company
are with savages or semi-savages, it may be left free to act, but
directly it becomes involved with a civilized power the state has
(if it wishes to retain the territory) to acquire by purchase the
political rights of the company, and it is obviously much easier to
induce a popular assembly to grant money for the purpose of
maintaining rights already existing than to acquire new ones.
With the strict system of government supervision enforced by
modern charters it is not easy for the state to be involved against
its will in foreign complications. Economically such companies
are also justifiable up to a certain point. When there is no other
means of entering into commercial relations with remote and
savage races save by enterprise of such magnitude that private
individuals could not incur the risk involved, then a company
may be well entrusted with special privileges for the purpose, as
an inventor is accorded a certain protection by law by means of a
patent which enables him to bring out his invention at a profit if
there is anything in it. But such privileges should not be continued
longer than is necessary for the purpose of reasonably
recompensing the adventurers. A successful company, even
when it has lost monopoly or privileges, has, by its command of
capital and general resources, established so strong a position that
private individuals or new companies can rarely compete with it
successfully. That this is so is clearly shown in the case of the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company as at present constituted. In colonizing
new lands these companies often act successfully. They have
proved more potent than the direct action of governments.
This may be seen in Africa, where France and England have of
late acquired vast areas, but have developed them with very
different results, acting from the opposite principles of private
and state promotion of colonization. Apart from national
characteristics, the individual has far more to gain under the
British system of private enterprise. A strong point in favour of
some of the British companies has been that their undertakings
have been practically extensions of existing British colonies
rather than entirely isolated ventures. But a chartered company
can never be anything but a transition stage of colonization;
sooner or later the state must take the lead. A company may act
beneficially so long as a country is undeveloped, but as soon as it
becomes even semi-civilized its conflicts with private interests
become so frequent and serious that its authority has to make
way for that of the central government.</p>

<p>The companies which have been formed in France during
recent years do not yet afford material for profitable study, for
they have been subject to so much vexatious interference from
home owing to lack of a fixed system of control sanctioned by
government, that they have not been able, like the British, to
develop along their own lines.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARTERHOUSE.<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> This name is an English corruption of
the French <i>maison chartreuse</i>, a religious house of the Carthusian
order. As such it occurs not uncommonly in England, in various
places (<i>e.g.</i> Charterhouse-on-Mendip, Charterhouse Hinton)
where the Carthusians were established. It is most familiar,
however, in its application to the Charterhouse, London. On
a site near the old city wall, west of the modern thoroughfare
of Aldersgate, a Carthusian monastery was founded in 1371 by
Sir Walter de Manny, a knight of French birth. After its
dissolution in 1535 the property passed through various hands.
In 1558, while in the possession of Lord North, it was occupied
by Queen Elizabeth during the preparations for her coronation,
and James I. held court here on his first entrance into London.
The Charterhouse was then in the hands of Thomas Howard,
earl of Suffolk, but in May 1611 it came into those of Thomas
Sutton (1532-1611) of Snaith, Lincolnshire. He acquired a
fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had
leased near Newcastle-on-Tyne, and afterwards, removing to
London, he carried on a commercial career. In the year of his
death, which took place on the 12th of December 1611, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page953" id="page953"></a>953</span>
endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the
hospital of King James; and in his will he bequeathed moneys
to maintain a chapel, hospital (almshouse) and school. The will
was hotly contested but upheld in court, and the foundation was
finally constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners
(&ldquo;gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne
arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck,
or servants in household to the King or Queen&rsquo;s Majesty&rdquo;), and
to educate forty boys. The school developed beyond the original
intentions of its founder, and now ranks among the most eminent
public schools in England. In 1872 it was removed, during the
headmastership (1863-1897) of the Rev. William Haig-Brown
(d. 1907), to new buildings near Godalming in Surrey, which were
opened on the 18th of June in that year. The number of foundation
scholarships is increased to sixty. The scholars are not now
distinguished by wearing a special dress or by forming a separate
house, though one house is known as Gownboys, preserving
the former title of the scholars. The land on which the old
school buildings stood in London was sold for new buildings
to accommodate the Merchant Taylors&rsquo; school, but the pensioners
still occupy their picturesque home, themselves picturesque
figures in the black gowns designed for them under the foundation.
The buildings, of mellowed red brick, include a panelled
chapel, in which is the founder&rsquo;s tomb, a fine dining-hall,
governors&rsquo; room with ornate ceiling and tapestried walls, the old
library, and the beautiful great staircase.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARTIER, ALAIN<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (c. 1392-c. 1430), French poet and political
writer, was born at Bayeux about 1392. Chartier belonged
to a family marked by considerable ability. His eldest brother
Guillaume became bishop of Paris; and Thomas became notary
to the king. Jean Chartier, a monk of St Denis, whose history
of Charles VII. is printed in vol. iii. of <i>Les Grands Chroniques de
Saint-Denis</i> (1477), was not, as is sometimes stated, also a
brother of the poet  Alain studied, as his elder brother had done,
at the university of Paris. His earliest poem is the <i>Livre des
quatre dames</i>, written after the battle of Agincourt. This was
followed by the <i>Débat du réveille-matin</i>, <i>La Belle Dame sans
merci</i>, and others. None of these poems show any very patriotic
feeling, though Chartier&rsquo;s prose is evidence that he was not
indifferent to the misfortunes of his country. He followed the
fortunes of the dauphin, afterwards Charles VII., acting in the
triple capacity of clerk, notary and financial secretary. In 1422
he wrote the famous <i>Quadrilogue-invectif</i>. The interlocutors
in this dialogue are France herself and the three orders of the
state. Chartier lays bare the abuses of the feudal army and the
sufferings of the peasants. He rendered an immense service to
his country by maintaining that the cause of France, though
desperate to all appearance, was not yet lost if the contending
factions could lay aside their differences in the face of the common
enemy. In 1424 Chartier was sent on an embassy to Germany,
and three years later he accompanied to Scotland the mission
sent to negotiate the marriage of Margaret of Scotland, then
not four years old, with the dauphin, afterwards Louis XI.
In 1429 he wrote the <i>Livre d&rsquo;espérance</i>, which contains a fierce
attack on the nobility and clergy. He was the author of a
diatribe on the courtiers of Charles VII. entitled <i>Le Curial</i>,
translated into English (<i>Here foloweth the copy of a lettre
whyche maistre A. Charetier wrote to his brother</i>) by Caxton
about 1484. The date of his death is to be placed about 1430.
A Latin epitaph, discovered in the 18th century, says, however,
that he was archdeacon of Paris, and declares that he died in the
city of Avignon in 1449. This is obviously not authentic, for
Alain described himself as a <i>simple clerc</i> and certainly died long
before 1449. The story of the famous kiss bestowed by Margaret
of Scotland on <i>la précieuse bouche de laquelle sont issus et sortis
tant de bons mots et vertueuses paroles</i> is mythical, for Margaret
did not come to France till 1436, after the poet&rsquo;s death; but the
story, first told by Guillaume Bouchet in his <i>Annales d&rsquo;Aquitaine</i>
(1524), is interesting, if only as a proof of the high degree of
estimation in which the ugliest man of his day was held. Jean
de Masles, who annotated a portion of his verse, has recorded
how the pages and young gentlemen of that epoch were required
daily to learn by heart passages of his <i>Bréviaire des nobles</i>.
John Lydgate studied him affectionately. His <i>Belle Dame sans
merci</i> was translated into English by Sir Richard Ros about
1640, with an introduction of his own; and Clément Marot and
Octavien de Saint-Gelais, writing fifty years after his death,
find many fair words for the old poet, their master and predecessor.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARTISM,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> the name given to a movement for political
reform in England, from the so-called &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Charter&rdquo; or
&ldquo;National Charter,&rdquo; the document in which in 1838 the scheme
of reforms was embodied. The movement itself may be traced
to the latter years of the 18th century. Checked for a while by
the reaction due to the excesses of the French Revolution, it
received a fresh impetus from the awful misery that followed
the Napoleonic wars and the economic changes due to the introduction
of machinery. The Six Acts of 1819 were directed,
not only against agrarian and industrial rioting, but against
the political movement of which Sir Francis Burdett was the
spokesman in the House of Commons, which demanded manhood
suffrage, the ballot, annual parliaments, the abolition of
the property qualification for members of parliament and their
payment. The movement was checked for a while by the
Reform Bill of 1832; but it was soon discovered that, though
the middle classes had been enfranchised, the economic and
political grievances of the labouring population remained unredressed.
Two separate movements now developed: one
socialistic, associated with the name of Robert Owen; the other
radical, aiming at the enfranchisement of the &ldquo;masses&rdquo; as the
first step to the amelioration of their condition. The latter was
represented in the Working Men&rsquo;s Association, by which in 1838
the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Charter&rdquo; was drawn up. It embodied exactly
the same programme as that of the radical reformers mentioned
above, with the addition of a demand for equal electoral districts.</p>

<p>In support of this programme a vigorous agitation began, the
principal leader of which was Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, whose irresponsible
and erratic oratory produced a vast effect. Monster
meetings were held, at which seditious language was occasionally
used, and slight collisions with the military took place. Petitions
of enormous size, signed in great part with fictitious names, were
presented to parliament; and a great many newspapers were
started, of which the <i>Northern Star</i>, conducted by Feargus
O&rsquo;Connor, had a circulation of 50,000. In November 1839 a
Chartist mob consisting of miners and others made an attack
on Newport, Mon. The rising was a total failure; the leaders,
John Frost and two others, were seized, were found guilty of high
treason, and were condemned to death. The sentence, however,
was changed to one of transportation, and Frost spent over
fourteen years in Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land. In 1854 he was pardoned,
and from 1856 until his death on the 29th of July 1877 he lived
in England. In 1840 the Chartist movement was still further
organized by the inauguration at Manchester of the National
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page954" id="page954"></a>954</span>
Charter Association, which rapidly became powerful, being the
head of about 400 sister societies, which are said to have numbered
40,000 members. Some time after, efforts were made
towards a coalition with the more moderate radicals, but these
failed; and a land scheme was started by O&rsquo;Connor, which
prospered for a few years. In 1844 the uncompromising spirit
of some of the leaders was well illustrated by their hostile attitude
towards the Anti-Corn-Law League. O&rsquo;Connor, especially,
entered into a public controversy with Cobden and Bright, in
which he was worsted. But it was not till 1848, during a season
of great suffering among the working classes, and under the
influence of the revolution at Paris, that the real strength of the
Chartist movement was discovered and the prevalent discontent
became known. Early in March disturbances occurred in
Glasgow which required the intervention of the military, while
in the manufacturing districts all over the west of Scotland the
operatives were ready to rise in the event of the main movement
succeeding. Some agitation, too, took place in Edinburgh and
in Manchester, but of a milder nature; in fact, while there was
a real and widespread discontent, men were indisposed to resort
to decided measures.</p>

<p>The principal scene of intended Chartist demonstration was
London. An enormous gathering of half a million was announced
for the 10th of April on Kennington Common, from which they
were to march to the Houses of Parliament to present a petition
signed by nearly six million names, in order by this imposing
display of numbers to secure the enactment of the six points.
Probably some of the more violent members of the party thought
to imitate the Parisian mob by taking power entirely into their own
hands. The announcement of the procession excited great alarm,
and the most decided measures were taken by the authorities to
prevent a rising. The procession was forbidden. The military
were called out under the command of the duke of Wellington,
and by him concealed near the bridges and other points where the
procession might attempt to force its way. Even the Bank of
England and other public buildings were put in a state of defence,
and special constables, to the number, it is said, of 170,000, were
enrolled, one of whom was destined shortly after to be the emperor
of the French. After all these gigantic preparations on both sides
the Chartist demonstration proved to be a very insignificant affair.
Instead of half a million, only about 50,000 assembled on Kennington
Common, and their leaders, Feargus O&rsquo;Connor and
Ernest Charles Jones, shrank from the responsibility of braving
the authorities by conducting the procession to the Houses of
Parliament. The monster petition was duly presented, and
scrutinized, with the result that the number of signatures was
found to have been grossly exaggerated, and that the most
unheard-of falsification of names had been resorted to. Thereafter
the movement specially called Chartism soon died out.
It became merged, so far as its political programme is concerned,
with the advancing radicalism of the general democratic
movement.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARTRES,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> a city of north-western France, capital of the
department of Eure-et-Loir, 55 m. S.W. of Paris on the railway
to Le Mans. Pop. (1906) 19,433. Chartres is built on the
left bank of the Eure, on a hill crowned by its famous cathedral,
the spires of which are a landmark in the surrounding country.
To the south-east stretches the fruitful plain of Beauce, &ldquo;the
granary of France,&rdquo; of which the town is the commercial centre.
The Eure, which at this point divides into three branches,
is crossed by several bridges, some of them ancient, and is
fringed in places by remains of the old fortifications, of which
the Porte Guillaume (14th century), a gateway flanked by towers,
is the most complete specimen. The steep, narrow streets of the
old town contrast with the wide, shady boulevards which encircle
it and divide it from the suburbs. The Clos St Jean, a pleasant
park, lies to the north-west, and squares and open spaces are
numerous. The cathedral of Notre-Dame (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>:
<i>Romanesque and Gothic Architecture in France</i>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cathedral</a></span>),
one of the finest Gothic churches in France, was founded in the
11th century by Bishop Fulbert on the site of an earlier church
destroyed by fire. In 1194 another conflagration laid waste
the new building then hardly completed; but clergy and people
set zealously to work, and the main part of the present structure
was finished by 1240. Though there have been numerous minor
additions and alterations since that time, the general character
of the cathedral is unimpaired. The upper woodwork was consumed
by fire in 1836, but the rest of the building was saved.
The statuary of the lateral portals, the stained glass of the 13th
century, and the choir-screen of the Renaissance are all unique
from the artistic standpoint. The cathedral is also renowned for
the beauty and perfect proportions of its western towers. That
to the south, the Clocher Vieux (351 ft. high), dates from the 13th
century; its upper portion is lower and less rich in design than
that of the Clocher Neuf (377 ft.), which was not completed till
the 16th century. In length the cathedral measures 440 ft., its
choir measures 150 ft. across, and the height of the vaulting is
121 ft. The abbey church of St Pierre, dating chiefly from the 13th
century, contains, besides some fine stained glass, twelve representations
of the apostles in enamel, executed about 1547 by
Léonard Limosin. Of the other churches of Chartres the chief
are St Aignan (13th, 16th and 17th centuries) and St Martin-au-Val
(12th century). The hôtel de ville, a building of the 17th
century, containing a museum and library, an older hôtel de
ville of the 13th century, and several medieval and Renaissance
houses, are of interest. There is a statue of General F.S.
Marceau-Desgraviers (b. 1769), a native of the town.</p>

<p>The town is the seat of a bishop, a prefecture, a court of assizes,
and has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber
of commerce, training colleges, a lycée for boys, a communal
college for girls, and a branch of the Bank of France. Its trade
is carried on chiefly on market-days, when the peasants of the
Beauce bring their crops and live-stock to be sold and make
their purchases. The game-pies and other delicacies of Chartres
are well known, and the industries also include flour-milling,
brewing, distilling, iron-founding, leather manufacture, dyeing,
and the manufacture of stained glass, billiard requisites,
hosiery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Chartres was one of the principal towns of the Carnutes, and
by the Romans was called <i>Autricum</i>, from the river <i>Autura</i>
(Eure), and afterwards <i>civitas Carnutum</i>. It was burnt by the
Normans in 858, and unsuccessfully besieged by them in 911.
In 1417 it fell into the hands of the English, from whom it was
recovered in 1432. It was attacked unsuccessfully by the
Protestants in 1568, and was taken in 1591 by Henry IV., who
was crowned there three years afterwards. In the Franco-German
War it was seized by the Germans on the 21st of October 1870,
and continued during the rest of the campaign an important
centre of operations. During the middle ages it was the chief
town of the district of Beauce, and gave its name to a countship
which was held by the counts of Blois and Champagne and afterwards
by the house of Châtillon, a member of which in 1286 sold
it to the crown. It was raised to the rank of a duchy in 1528 by
Francis I. After the time of Louis XIV. the title of duke of
Chartres was hereditary in the family of Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHARTREUSE,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> a liqueur, so called from having been made
at the famous Carthusian monastery, La Grande Chartreuse, at
Grenoble (see below). In consequence of the Associations Law,
the Chartreux monks left France in 1904, and now continue the
manufacture of this liqueur in Spain. There are two main varieties
of Chartreuse, the green and the yellow. The green contains
about 57, the yellow about 43% of alcohol. There are other
differences due to the varying nature and quantity of the
flavouring matters employed, but the secrets of manufacture are
jealously guarded. The genuine liqueur is undoubtedly produced
by means of a distillation process.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHARTREUSE, LA GRANDE,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> the mother house of the very
severe order of Carthusian monks (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carthusians</a></span>). It is
situated in the French department of the Isère, about 12½ m.
N. of Grenoble, at a height of 3205 ft. above the sea, in the heart
of a group of limestone mountains, and not far from the source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page955" id="page955"></a>955</span>
of the Guiers Mort. The original settlement here was founded
by St Bruno about 1084, and derived its name from the small
village to the S.E., formerly known as Cartusia, and now as St
Pierre de Chartreuse. The first convent on the present site was
built between 1132 and 1137, but the actual buildings date only
from about 1676, the older ones having been often burnt. The
convent stands in a very picturesque position in a large meadow,
sloping to the S.W., and watered by a tiny tributary of the Guiers
Mort. On the north, fine forests extend to the Col de la Ruchère,
and on the west rise well-wooded heights, while on the east
tower white limestone ridges, culminating in the Grand Som
(6670 ft.). One of the most famous of the early Carthusian
monks was St Hugh of Lincoln, who lived here from 1160 to
1181, when he went to England to found the first Carthusian
house at Witham in Somerset; in 1186 he became bishop of
Lincoln, and before his death in 1200 had built the angel choir
and other portions of the wonderful cathedral there.</p>

<p>The principal approach to the convent is from St Laurent du
Pont, a village situated on the Guiers Mort, and largely built
by the monks&mdash;it is connected by steam tramways with Voiron
(for Grenoble) and St Béron (for Chambéry). Among the other
routes may be mentioned those from Grenoble by Le Sappey, or
by the Col de la Charmette, or from Chambéry by the Col de
Couz and the village of Les Échelles. St Laurent is about 5½ m.
from the convent. The road mounts along the Guiers Mort and
soon reaches the hamlet of Fourvoirie, so called from <i>forata via</i>,
as about 1510 the road was first pierced hence towards the
convent. Here are iron forges, and here was formerly the chief
centre of the manufacture of the famed Chartreuse liqueur.
Beyond, the road enters the &ldquo;Désert&rdquo; and passes through most
delightful scenery. Some way farther the Guiers Mort is crossed
by the modern bridge of St Bruno, the older bridge of Parant
being still visible higher up the stream. Here begins the splendid
carriage road, constructed by M.E. Viaud between 1854 and
1856. It soon passes beneath the bold pinnacle of the Oeillette
or Aiguillette, beyond which formerly women were not allowed
to penetrate. After passing through four tunnels the road bends
north (leaving the Guiers Mort which flows past St Pierre de
Chartreuse), and the valley soon opens to form the upland hollow
in which are the buildings of the convent. These are not very
striking, the high roofs of dark slate, the cross-surmounted
turrets and the lofty clock-tower being the chief features. But
the situation is one of ideal peace and repose. Women were
formerly lodged in the old infirmary, close to the main gate,
which is now a hôtel. Within the conventual buildings are four
halls formerly used for the reception of the priors of the various
branch houses in France, Italy, Burgundy and Germany. The
very plain and unadorned chapel dates from the 15th century,
but the cloisters, around which cluster the thirty-six small houses
for the fully professed monks, are of later date. The library contained
before the Revolution a very fine collection of books and
MSS., now mostly in the town library at Grenoble.</p>

<p>The monks were expelled in 1793, but allowed to return in
1816, but then they had to pay rent for the use of the buildings
and the forests around, though both one and the other were due
to the industry of their predecessors. They were again expelled
in 1904, and are dispersed in various houses in England, at
Pinerolo (Italy) and at Tarragona (Spain). It is at the last-named
spot that the various pharmaceutical preparations are
now manufactured for which they are famous (though sold only
since about 1840)&mdash;the <i>Elixir</i>, the <i>Boule d&rsquo;acier</i> (a mineral paste
or salve), and the celebrated <i>liqueur</i>. The magnificent revenues
derived from the profits of this manufacture were devoted by the
monks to various purposes of benevolence, especially in the
neighbouring villages, which owe to this source their churches,
schools, hospitals, &amp;c., &amp;c., built and maintained at the expense
of the monks.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHASE, SALMON PORTLAND<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1808-1873), American statesman
and jurist, was born in Cornish township, New Hampshire,
on the 13th of January 1808. His father died in 1817, and the
son passed several years (1820-1824) in Ohio with his uncle,
Bishop Philander Chase (1775-1852), the foremost pioneer of the
Protestant Episcopal Church in the West, the first bishop of
Ohio (1819-1831), and after 1835 bishop of Illinois. He graduated
at Dartmouth College in 1826, and after studying law under
William Wirt, attorney-general of the United States, in
Washington, D.C., was admitted to the bar in 1829, and removed
to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1830. Here he soon gained a position of
prominence at the bar, and published an annotated edition,
which long remained standard, of the laws of Ohio. At a time
when public opinion in Cincinnati was largely dominated by
Southern business connexions, Chase, influenced probably by
James G. Birney, associated himself after about 1836 with the
anti-slavery movement, and became recognized as the leader of
the political reformers as opposed to the Garrisonian abolitionists.
To the cause he freely gave his services as a lawyer, and was
particularly conspicuous as counsel for fugitive slaves seized
in Ohio for rendition to slavery under the Fugitive Slave Law
of 1793&mdash;indeed, he came to be known as the &ldquo;attorney-general
of fugitive slaves.&rdquo; His argument (1847) in the famous Van
Zandt case before the United States Supreme Court attracted
particular attention, though in this as in other cases of the
kind the judgment was against him. In brief he contended that
slavery was &ldquo;local, not national,&rdquo; that it could exist only by
virtue of positive State Law, that the Federal government was
not empowered by the Constitution to create slavery anywhere,
and that &ldquo;when a slave leaves the jurisdiction of a state he
ceases to be a slave, because he continues to be a man and
leaves behind him the law which made him a slave.&rdquo; In 1841 he
abandoned the Whig party, with which he had previously been
affiliated, and for seven years was the undisputed leader of the
Liberty party in Ohio; he was remarkably skilful in drafting
platforms and addresses, and it was he who prepared the national
Liberty platform of 1843 and the Liberty address of 1845.
Realizing in time that a third party movement could not succeed,
he took the lead during the campaign of 1848 in combining the
Liberty party with the Barnburners or Van Buren Democrats
of New York to form the Free-Soilers. He drafted the famous
Free-Soil platform, and it was largely through his influence that
Van Buren was nominated for the presidency. His object, however,
was not to establish a permanent new party organization,
but to bring pressure to bear upon Northern Democrats to force
them to adopt a policy opposed to the further extension of
slavery.</p>

<p>In 1849 he was elected to the United States Senate as the
result of a coalition between the Democrats and a small group
of Free-Soilers in the state legislature; and for some years
thereafter, except in 1852, when he rejoined the Free-Soilers,
he classed himself as an Independent Democrat, though he
was out of harmony with the leaders of the Democratic party.
During his service in the Senate (1849-1855) he was pre-eminently
the champion of anti-slavery in that body, and no one spoke
more ably than he did against the Compromise Measures of 1850
and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854. The Kansas-Nebraska
legislation, and the subsequent troubles in Kansas, having
convinced him of the futility of trying to influence the Democrats,
he assumed the leadership in the North-west of the movement
to form a new party to oppose the extension of slavery. The
&ldquo;Appeal of the Independent Democrats in Congress to the
People of the United States,&rdquo; written by Chase and Giddings,
and published in the New York <i>Times</i> of the 24th of January
1854, may be regarded as the earliest draft of the Republican
party creed. He was the first Republican governor of Ohio,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page956" id="page956"></a>956</span>
serving from 1855 to 1859. Although, with the exception of
Seward, he was the most prominent Republican in the country,
and had done more against slavery than any other Republican,
he failed to secure the nomination for the presidency in 1860,
partly because his views on the question of protection were not
orthodox from a Republican point of view, and partly because
the old line Whig element could not forgive his coalition with the
Democrats in the senatorial campaign of 1849; his uncompromising
and conspicuous anti-slavery record, too, was against
him from the point of view of &ldquo;availability.&rdquo; As secretary
of the treasury in President Lincoln&rsquo;s cabinet in 1861-1864,
during the first three years of the Civil War, he rendered services
of the greatest value. That period of crisis witnessed two great
changes in American financial policy, the establishment of a
national banking system and the issue of a legal tender paper
currency. The former was Chase&rsquo;s own particular measure.
He suggested the idea, worked out all of the important principles
and many of the details, and induced Congress to accept them.
The success of that system alone warrants his being placed in
the first rank of American financiers. It not only secured an
immediate market for government bonds, but it also provided
a permanent uniform national currency, which, though inelastic,
is absolutely stable. The issue of legal tenders, the greatest
financial blunder of the war, was made contrary to his wishes,
although he did not, as he perhaps ought to have done, push
his opposition to the point of resigning.</p>

<p>Perhaps Chase&rsquo;s chief defect as a statesman was an insatiable
desire for supreme office. It was partly this ambition, and
also temperamental differences from the president, which led
him to retire from the cabinet in June 1864. A few months
later (December 6, 1864) he was appointed chief justice of the
United States Supreme Court to succeed Judge Taney, a position
which he held until his death in 1873. Among his most important
decisions were <i>Texas v. White</i> (7 Wallace, 700), 1869, in
which he asserted that the Constitution provided for an &ldquo;indestructible
union composed of indestructible states,&rdquo; <i>Veazie
Bank</i> v. <i>Fenno</i> (8 Wallace, 533), 1869, in defence of that part
of the banking legislation of the Civil War which imposed a
tax of 10% on state bank-notes, and <i>Hepburn</i> v. <i>Griswold</i> (8
Wallace, 603), 1869, which declared certain parts of the legal
tender acts to be unconstitutional. When the legal tender
decision was reversed after the appointment of new judges,
1871-1872 (Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wallace, 457), Chase prepared
a very able dissenting opinion. Toward the end of his life he
gradually drifted back toward his old Democratic position, and
made an unsuccessful effort to secure the nomination of the
Democratic party for the presidency in 1872. He died in New
York city on the 7th of May 1873. Chase was one of the ablest
political leaders of the Civil War period, and deserves to be
placed in the front rank of American statesmen.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHASE, SAMUEL<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1741-1811), American jurist, was born in
Somerset county, Maryland, on the 17th of April 1741. He was
admitted to the bar at Annapolis in 1761, and for more than
twenty years was a member of the Maryland legislature. He
took an active part in the resistance to the Stamp Act, and from
1774 to 1778 and 1784 to 1785 was a member of the Continental
Congress. With Benjamin Franklin and Charles Carroll he was
sent by Congress in 1776 to win over the Canadians to the side
of the revolting colonies, and after his return did much to
persuade Maryland to advocate a formal separation of the
thirteen colonies from Great Britain, he himself being one of
those who signed the Declaration of Independence on the 2nd
of August 1776. In this year he was also a member of the
convention which framed the first constitution for the state of
Maryland. After serving in the Maryland convention which
ratified for that state the Federal Constitution, and there
vigorously opposing ratification, though afterwards he was an
ardent Federalist, he became in 1791 chief judge of the Maryland
general court, which position he resigned in 1796 for that of an
associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
His radical Federalism, however, led him to continue active in
politics, and he took advantage of every opportunity, on the
bench and off, to promote the cause of his party. His overbearing
conduct while presiding at the trials of John Fries for
treason, and of James Thompson Callender (d. 1813) for seditious
libel in 1800, drove the lawyers for the defence from the court,
and evoked the wrath of the Republicans, who were stirred to
action by a political harangue on the evil tendencies of democracy
which he delivered as a charge to a grand jury at Baltimore in
1803. The House of Representatives adopted a resolution of
impeachment in March 1804, and on the 7th of December 1804
the House managers, chief among whom were John Randolph,
Joseph H. Nicholson (1770-1817), and Caesar A. Rodney (1772-1824),
laid their articles of impeachment before the Senate.
The trial, with frequent interruptions and delays, lasted from
the 2nd of January to the 1st of March 1805. Judge Chase was
defended by the ablest lawyers in the country, including Luther
Martin, Robert Goodloe Harper (1765-1825), Philip Barton Key
(1757-1815), Charles Lee (1758-1815), and Joseph Hopkinson
(1770-1842). The indictment, in eight articles, dealt with his
conduct in the Fries and Callender trials, with his treatment of
a Delaware grand jury, and (in article viii.) with his making
&ldquo;highly indecent, extra-judicial&rdquo; reflections upon the national
administration, probably the greatest offence in Republican eyes.
On only three articles was there a majority against Judge Chase,
the largest, on article viii., being four short of the necessary
two-thirds to convict. &ldquo;The case,&rdquo; says Henry Adams, &ldquo;proved
impeachment to be an impracticable thing for partisan purposes,
and it decided the permanence of those lines of constitutional
development which were a reflection of the common law.&rdquo;
Judge Chase resumed his seat on the bench, and occupied it
until his death on the 19th of June 1811.</p>

He was a pupil of B.F. Hays at Indianapolis, of J.O. Eaton in

In New York he established a school of his own, after teaching
with success for some years at the Art Students&rsquo; League. A

with distinction the figure, landscape and still-life,
he is perhaps best known by his portraits, his sitters numbering

<p><span class="bold">CHASE.<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> (1) (Fr. <i>chasse</i>, from Lat. <i>captare</i>, frequentative
of <i>capere</i>, to take), the pursuit of wild animals for food or
sport (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hunting</a></span>). The word is used of the pursuit of anything,
and also of the thing pursued, as, in naval warfare, of
a ship. A transferred meaning is that of park land reserved
for the breeding and hunting of wild animals, in which sense it
appears in various place-names in England, as Cannock Chase.
It is also a term for a stroke in tennis (<i>q.v.</i>). (2) (Fr. <i>châsse</i>,
Lat. <i>capsa</i>, a box, cf. <i>caisse</i>, and &ldquo;chest&rdquo;), an enclosure, such

<p><span class="bold">CHASING,<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Enchasing</span>, the art of producing figures and
ornamental patterns, either raised or indented, on metallic
surfaces by means of steel tools or punches. It is practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page957" id="page957"></a>957</span>
extensively for the ornamentation of goldsmith and silversmith
work, electro-plate and similar objects, being employed to
produce bold flutings and bosses, and in another manner utilized
for imitating engraved surfaces. Minute work can be produced
by this method, perfect examples of which may be seen in the
watch-cases chased by G.M. Moser, R.A. (1704-1783). The
chaser first outlines the pattern on the surface he is to ornament,
after which, if the work involves bold or high embossments,
these are blocked out by a process termed &ldquo;snarling.&rdquo; The
snarling iron is a long iron tool turned up at the end, and made so
that when securely fastened in a vise the upturned end can reach
and press against any portion of the interior of the vase or other
object to be chased. The part to be raised being held firmly
against the upturned point of the snarling iron, the workman
gives the shoulder or opposite end of the iron a sharp blow,
which causes the point applied to the work to give it a percussive
stroke, and thus throw up the surface of the metal held against
the tool. When the blocking out from the interior is finished,
or when no such embossing is required, the object to be chased
is filled with molten pitch, which is allowed to harden. It is
then fastened to a sandbag, and with hammer and a multitude
of small punches of different outline the whole details of the
pattern, lined, smooth or &ldquo;matt,&rdquo; are worked out. Embossing
and stamping from steel dies and rolled ornaments have long
since taken the place of chased ornamentations in the cheaper
kinds of plated works. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embossing</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHASLES, VICTOR EUPHÉMIEN PHILARÈTE<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span> (1798-1873),
French critic and man of letters, was born at Mainvilliers (Eure
et Loir) on the 8th of October 1798. His father, Pierre Jacques
Michel Chasles (1754-1826), was a member of the Convention,
and was one of those who voted the death of Louis XVI. He
brought up his son according to the principles of Rousseau&rsquo;s
<i>Émile</i>, and the boy, after a régime of outdoor life, followed by
some years&rsquo; classical study, was apprenticed to a printer, so that
he might make acquaintance with manual labour. His master
was involved in one of the plots of 1815, and Philarète suffered
two months&rsquo; imprisonment. On his release he was sent to
London, where he worked for the printer Valpy on editions of
classical authors. He wrote articles for the English reviews,
and on his return to France did much to popularize the study
of English authors. He was also one of the earliest to draw
attention in France to Scandinavian and Russian literature.
He contributed to the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i>, until he had a
violent quarrel, terminating in a lawsuit, with François Buloz,
who won his case. He became librarian of the Bibliothèque
Mazarine, and from 1841 was professor of comparative literature
at the Collège de France. During his active life he produced
some fifty volumes of literary history and criticism, and of
social history, much of which is extremely valuable. He died
at Venice on the 18th of July 1873. His son, Émile Chasles
(b. 1827), was a philologist of some reputation.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Among his best critical works is <i>Dix-huitième Siècle en Angleterre</i>
... (1846), one of a series of 20 vols. of <i>Études de littérature comparée</i>
(1846-1875), which he called later <i>Trente ans de critique</i>. An
account of his strenuous boyhood is given in his <i>Maison de mon père</i>.
His <i>Mémoires</i> (1876-1877) did not fulfil the expectations based on his

<p><span class="bold">CHASSELOUP-LAUBAT, FRANÇOIS,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquis de</span> (1754-1833),
French general and military engineer, was born at St
Sernin (Lower Charente) on the 18th of August 1754, of a noble
family, and entered the French engineers in 1774. He was still
a subaltern at the outbreak of the Revolution, becoming captain
in 1791. His ability as a military engineer was recognized in
the campaigns of 1792 and 1793. In the following year he won
distinction in various actions and was promoted successively
<i>chef de bataillon</i> and colonel. He was chief of engineers at the
siege of Mainz in 1796, after which he was sent to Italy. He
there conducted the first siege of Mantua, and reconnoitred the
positions and lines of advance of the army of Bonaparte. He
was promoted general of brigade before the close of the campaign,
and was subsequently employed in fortifying the new Rhine
frontier of France. His work as chief of engineers in the army
of Italy (1799) was conspicuously successful, and after the battle
of Novi he was made general of division. When Napoleon took
the field in 1800 to retrieve the disasters of 1799, he again
selected Chasseloup as his engineer general. During the peace of
1801-1805 he was chiefly employed in reconstructing the defences
of northern Italy, and in particular the afterwards famous
Quadrilateral. His <i>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> was the great fortress of Alessandria
on the Tanaro. In 1805 he remained in Italy with
Masséna, but at the end of 1806 Napoleon, then engaged in the
Polish campaign, called him to the <i>Grande Armée</i>, with which
he served in the campaign of 1806-07, directing the sieges of
Colberg, Danzig and Stralsund. During the Napoleonic domination
in Germany, Chasseloup reconstructed many fortresses,
in particular Magdeburg. In the campaign of 1809 he again
served in Italy. In 1810 Napoleon made him a councillor of
state. His last campaign was that of 1812 in Russia. He
retired from active service soon afterwards, though in 1814 he
was occasionally engaged in the inspection and construction
of fortifications. Louis XVIII. made him a peer of France and
a knight of St Louis. He refused to join Napoleon in the Hundred
Days, but after the second Restoration he voted in the chamber
of peers against the condemnation of Marshal Ney. In politics
he belonged to the constitutional party. The king created him
a marquis. Chasseloup&rsquo;s later years were employed chiefly in
putting in order his manuscripts, a task which he had to abandon
owing to the failure of his sight. His only published work was
<i>Correspondence d&rsquo;un général français, &amp;c. sur divers sujets</i> (Paris,
1801, republished Milan, 1805 and 1811, under the title <i>Correspondance
de deux générals, &amp;c., essais sur quelques parties d&rsquo;artillerie
et de fortification</i>). The most important of his papers are
in manuscript in the Depôt of Fortifications, Paris.</p>

<p>As an engineer Chasseloup was an adherent, though of advanced
views, of the old bastioned system. He followed in many
respects the engineer Bousmard, whose work was published in
1797 and who fell, as a Prussian officer, in the defence of Danzig
in 1807 against Chasseloup&rsquo;s own attack. His front was applied
to Alessandria, as has been stated, and contains many elaborations
of the bastion trace, with, in particular, masked flanks in
the tenaille, which served as extra flanks of the bastions. The
bastion itself was carefully and minutely retrenched. The
ordinary ravelin he replaced by a heavy casemated caponier
after the example of Montalembert, and, like Bousmard&rsquo;s, his
own ravelin was a large and powerful work pushed out beyond
the glacis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHASSEPOT,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> officially &ldquo;fusil modèle 1866,&rdquo; a military breech-loading
rifle, famous as the arm of the French forces in the Franco-German
War of 1870-71. It was so called after its inventor,
Antoine Alphonse Chassepot (1833-1905), who, from 1857 onwards,
had constructed various experimental forms of breech-loader,
and it became the French service weapon in 1866. In
the following year it made its first appearance on the battle-field
at Mentana (November 3rd, 1867), where it inflicted severe losses
upon Garibaldi&rsquo;s troops. In the war of 1870 it proved very
greatly superior to the German needle-gun. The breech was
closed by a bolt very similar to those of more modern rifles, and
amongst the technical features of interest were the method of
obturation, which was similar in principle to the de Bange
obturator for heavy guns (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ordnance</a></span>), and the retention
of the paper cartridge. The principal details of the chassepot
are:&mdash;weight of rifle, 9 &#8468; 5 oz.; length with bayonet, 6 ft. 2 in.;
calibre, .433 in.; weight of bullet (lead), 386 grains; weight of
charge (black powder), 86.4 grains; muzzle velocity, 1328 f.s.;
sighted to 1312 yds. (1200 m.). The chassepot was replaced in
1874 by the Gras rifle, which had a metal cartridge, and all rifles
of the older model remaining in store were converted to take the
same ammunition (fusil modèle 1866/74).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHASTELARD, PIERRE DE BOCSOZEL DE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (1540-1563),
French poet, was born in Dauphiné, a scion of the house of
Bayard. His name is inseparably connected with Mary, queen
of Scots. From the service of the Constable Montmorency,
Chastelard, then a page, passed to the household of Marshal
Damville, whom he accompanied in his journey to Scotland in
escort of Mary (1561). He returned to Paris in the marshal&rsquo;s train,
but left for Scotland again shortly afterward, bearing letters of
recommendation to Mary from his old protector, Montmorency,
and the <i>Regrets</i> addressed to the ex-queen of France by Pierre
Ronsard, his master in the art of song. He undertook to transmit
to the poet the service of plate with which Mary rewarded
him. But he had fallen in love with the queen, who is said to
have encouraged his passion. Copies of verse passed between
them; she lost no occasion of showing herself partial to his
person and conversation. The young man hid himself under her
bed, where he was discovered by her maids of honour. Mary
pardoned the offence, and the old familiar terms between them
were resumed. Chastelard was so rash as again to violate her
privacy. He was discovered a second time, seized, sentenced
and hanged the next morning. He met his fate valiantly and
consistently, reading, on his way to the scaffold, his master&rsquo;s
noble <i>Hymne de la mort</i>, and turning at the instant of doom
towards the palace of Holyrood, to address to his unseen mistress
the famous farewell&mdash;&ldquo;Adieu, toi si belle et si cruelle, qui me
tues et que je ne puis cesser d&rsquo;aimer.&rdquo; This at least is the version
of the <i>Mémoires</i> of Brantôme, who is, however, notoriously
untrustworthy. But for his madness of love, it is possible that
Chastelard would have left no shadow or shred of himself behind.
As it is, his life and death are of interest as illustrating the wild
days in which his lot was cast.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHASTELLAIN, GEORGES<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (d. 1475), Burgundian chronicler,
was a native of Alost in Flanders. He derived his surname from
the fact that his ancestors were burgraves or châtelains of the
town; his parents, who belonged to illustrious Flemish families,
were probably the Jean Chastellain and his wife Marie de Masmines
mentioned in the town records in 1425 and 1432. A copy
of an epitaph originally at Valenciennes states that he died on
the 20th of March 1474-5 aged seventy. But since he states
that he was so young a child in 1430 that he could not recollect
the details of events in that year, and since he was &ldquo;<i>écolier</i>&rdquo; at
Louvain in 1430, his birth may probably be placed nearer 1415
than 1405. He saw active service in the Anglo-French wars and
probably elsewhere, winning the surname of <i>L&rsquo;adventureux</i>. In
1434 he received a gift from Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy,
for his military services, but on the conclusion of the peace of
Arras in the next year he abandoned soldiering for diplomacy.
The next ten years were spent in France, where he was connected
with Georges de la Trémoille, and afterwards entered the household
of Pierre de Brézé, at that time seneschal of Poitou, by
whom he was employed on missions to the duke of Burgundy,
in an attempt to establish better relations between Charles VII.
and the duke. During these years Chastellain had ample opportunity
of obtaining an intimate knowledge of French affairs, but
on the further breach between the two princes, Chastellain left
the French service to enter Philip&rsquo;s household. He was at first
pantler, then carver, titles which are misleading as to the nature
of his services, which were those of a diplomatist; and in 1457
he became a member of the ducal council. He was continually
employed on diplomatic errands until 1455, when, owing apparently
to ill-health, he received apartments in the palace of the
counts of Hainaut at Salle-le-Comte, Valenciennes, with a considerable
pension, on condition that the recipient should put in
writing &ldquo;<i>choses nouvelles et morales</i>,&rdquo; and a chronicle of notable
events. That is to say, he was appointed Burgundian historiographer
with a recommendation to write also on other subjects
not strictly within the scope of a chronicler. From this time
he worked hard at his <i>Chronique</i>, with occasional interruptions
in his retreat to fulfil missions in France, or to visit the Burgundian
court. He was assisted, from about 1463 onwards, by
his disciple and continuator, Jean Molinet, whose rhetorical and
redundant style may be fairly traced in some passages of the
<i>Chronique</i>. Charles the Bold maintained the traditions of his
house as a patron of literature, and showed special favour to
Chastellain, who, after being constituted <i>indiciaire</i> or chronicler
of the order of the Golden Fleece, was himself made a knight of
the order on the 2nd of May 1473. He died at Valenciennes
on the 13th of February (according to the treasury accounts),
or on the 20th of March (according to his epitaph) 1475. He
left an illegitimate son, to whom was paid in 1524 one hundred
and twenty livres for a copy of the <i>Chronique</i> intended for
Charles V.&rsquo;s sister Mary, queen of Hungary. Only about one-third
of the whole work, which extended from 1410 to 1474, is
known to be in existence, but MSS. carried by the Habsburgs
to Vienna or Madrid may possibly yet be discovered.</p>

<p>Among his contemporaries Chastellain acquired a great
reputation by his poems and occasional pieces now little considered.
The unfinished state of his <i>Chronique</i> at the time of
his death, coupled with political considerations, may possibly
account for the fact that it remained unprinted during the
century that followed his death, and his historical work was only
disinterred from the libraries of Arras, Paris and Brussels by the
painstaking researches of M. Buchon in 1825. Chastellain was
constantly engaged during the earlier part of his career in
negotiations between the French and Burgundian courts, and
thus had personal knowledge of the persons and events dealt
with in his history. A partisan element in writing of French
affairs was inevitable in a Burgundian chronicle. This defect
appears most strongly in his treatment of Joan of Arc; and the
attack on Agnes Sorel seems to have been dictated by the
dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.), then a refugee in Burgundy, of
whom he was afterwards to become a severe critic. He was not,
however, misled, as his more picturesque predecessor Froissart
had been, by feudal and chivalric tradition into misconception
of the radical injustice of the English cause in France; and
except in isolated instances where Burgundian interests were at
stake, he did full justice to the patriotism of Frenchmen. Among
his most sympathetic portraits are those of his friend Pierre de
Brézé and of Jacques C&oelig;ur. His French style, based partly
on his Latin reading, has, together with its undeniable vigour
and picturesqueness, the characteristic redundance and rhetorical
quality of the Burgundian school. Chastellain was no mere
annalist, but proposed to fuse and shape his vast material to his
own conclusions, in accordance with his political experience.
The most interesting feature of his work is the skill with which
he pictures the leading figures of his time. His &ldquo;characters&rdquo;
are the fruit of acute and experienced observation, and abound
in satirical traits, although the 42nd chapter of his second book,
devoted expressly to portraiture, is headed &ldquo;<i>Comment Georges
escrit et mentionne les louanges vertueuses des princes de son temps.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The known extant fragments of Chastellain&rsquo;s <i>Chroniques</i> with
his other works were edited by Kervyn de Lettenhove for the
Brussels Academy in 1863-1866 (8 vols., Brussels) as <i>&OElig;uvres de
Georges Chastellain</i>. This edition includes all that had been already
published by Buchon in his <i>Collection de chroniques</i> and <i>Choix de
chroniques</i> (material subsequently incorporated in the <i>Panthéon
littéraire</i>), and portions printed by Renard in his <i>Trésor national</i>,
vol. i. and by Quicherat in the <i>Procès de la Pucelle</i> vol. iv. Kervyn
de Lettenhove&rsquo;s text includes the portions of the chronicle covering
the periods September 1419, October 1422, January 1430 to December
1431, 1451-1452, July 1454 to October 1458, July 1461 to July 1463,
and, with omissions, June 1467 to September 1470; and three volumes
of minor pieces of considerable interest, especially <i>Le Temple de
Boccace</i>, dedicated to Margaret of Anjou, and the <i>Déprécation</i> for
Pierre Brézé, imprisoned by Louis XI. In the case of these minor
works the attribution to Chastellain is in some cases erroneous,
notably in the case of the <i>Livre des faits de Jacques de Lalain</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page959" id="page959"></a>959</span>
is the work of Lefèbvre de Saint-Remi, herald of the Golden Fleece.
In the allegorical <i>Oultré d&rsquo;amour</i> it has been thought a real romance
between Brézé and a lady of the royal house is concealed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHASUBLE<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (Fr. <i>chasuble</i>, Ger. <i>Kasel</i>, Span. <i>casulla</i>; Late
Lat. <i>casula</i>, a little house, hut, from <i>casa</i>), a liturgical vestment
of the Catholic Church. It is the outermost garment worn by
bishops and priests at the celebration of the Mass, forming
with the alb (<i>q.v.</i>) the most essential part of the eucharistic
vestments. Since it is only used at the Mass, or rarely for
functions intimately connected with the sacrament of the altar,
it may be regarded as the Mass vestment <i>par excellence</i>. The
chasuble is thus in a special sense the sacerdotal vestment, and
at the ordination of priests, according to the Roman rite, the
bishop places on the candidate a chasuble rolled up at the back
(<i>planeta plicata</i>), with the words, &ldquo;Take the sacerdotal robe,
the symbol of love,&rdquo; &amp;c.; at the end of the ordination Mass the
vestment is unrolled.
The chasuble or
<i>planeta</i> (as it is called
in the Roman missal),
according to the prevailing
model in the
Roman Catholic
Church, is a scapular-like
cloak, with a hole
in the middle for the
head, falling down
over breast and back,
and leaving the arms
uncovered at the sides.
Its shape and size,
however, differ considerably
in various
countries (see fig. 1),
while some churches&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
those of certain
monastic orders&mdash;have
retained or reverted
to the earlier
&ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; forms to
be described later.
According to the decisions
of the Congregation
of Rites
chasubles must not
be of linen, cotton or
woollen stuffs, but of silk; though a mixture of wool (or linen
and cotton) and silk is allowed if the silk completely cover the
other material on the outer side; spun glass thread, as a substitute
for gold or silver thread, is also forbidden, owing to the
possible danger to the priest&rsquo;s health through broken fragments
falling into the chalice.</p>

<p>The chasuble, like the kindred vestments (the <span class="grk" title="phelonion">&#966;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, &amp;c.)
in the Eastern Churches, is derived from the Roman <i>paenula</i> or
<i>planeta</i>, a cloak worn by all classes and both sexes in the Graeco-Roman
world (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>). Though early used in the
celebration of the liturgy it had for several centuries no specifically
liturgical character, the first clear instances of its ritual
use being in a letter of St Germanus of Paris (d. 576), and the
next in the twenty-eighth canon of the Council of Toledo (633).
Much later than this, however, it was still an article of everyday
clerical dress, and as such was prescribed by the German council
convened by Carloman and presided over by St Boniface in 742.
Amalarius of Metz, in his <i>De ecclesiasticis officiis</i> (ii. 19), tells us
in 816 that the <i>casula</i> is the <i>generale indumentum sacrorum
ducum</i> and &ldquo;is proper generally to all the clergy.&rdquo; It was not
until the 11th century, when the cope (<i>q.v.</i>) had become established
as a liturgical vestment, that the chasuble began to be
reserved as special to the sacrifice of the Mass. As illustrating
this process Father Braun (p. 170) cites an interesting correspondence
between Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury and John
of Avranches, archbishop of Rouen, as to the propriety of a
bishop wearing a chasuble at the consecration of a church,
Lanfranc maintaining as an established principle that the
vestment should be reserved for the Mass. By the 13th century,
with the final development of the ritual of the Mass, the chasuble
became definitely fixed as the vestment of the celebrating priest;
though to this day in the Roman Church relics of the earlier
general use of the chasuble survive in the <i>planeta plicata</i> worn
by deacons and subdeacons in Lent and Advent, and other
penitential seasons.</p>

<p>At the Reformation the chasuble was rejected with the other
vestments by the more extreme Protestants. Its use, however,
survived in the Lutheran churches; and though in those of
Germany it is no longer worn, it still forms part of the liturgical
costume of the Scandinavian Evangelical churches. In the
Church of England, though it was prescribed alternatively with
the cope in the First Prayer-Book of Edward VI., it was ultimately
discarded, with the other &ldquo;Mass vestments,&rdquo; the cope
being substituted for it at the celebration of the Holy Communion
in cathedral and collegiate churches; its use has, however,
during the last fifty years been widely revived in connexion with
the reactionary movement in the direction of the pre-Reformation
doctrine of the eucharist. The difficult question of its legality
is discussed in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Form.</i>&mdash;The chasuble was originally a tent-like robe which
fell in loose folds below the knee (see Plate I. fig. 4). Its obvious
inconvenience for celebrating the holy mysteries, however,
caused its gradual modification. The object of the change was
primarily to leave the hands of the celebrant freer for the careful
performance of the manual acts, and to this end a process of
cutting away at the sides of the vestment began, which continued
until the tent-shaped chasuble of the 12th century had developed
in the 16th into the scapular-like vestment at present in use.
This process was, moreover, hastened by the substitution of
costly and elaborately embroidered materials for the simple
stuffs of which the vestment had originally been composed;
for, as it became heavier and stiffer, it necessarily had to be
made smaller. For the extremely exiguous proportions of some
chasubles actually in use, which have been robbed of all the
beauty of form they ever possessed, less respectable motives
have sometimes been responsible, viz. the desire of their makers
to save on the materials. The most beautiful form of the chasuble
is undoubtedly the &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; (see the figure of Bishop Johannes
of Lübeck in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>), which is the form most
affected by the Anglican clergy, as being that worn in the
English Church before the Reformation.</p>

<p><i>Decoration.</i>&mdash;Though <i>planetae</i> decorated with narrow orphreys
are occasionally met with in the monuments of the early centuries,
these vestments were until the 10th century generally quite
plain, and even at the close of this century, when the custom of
decorating the chasuble with orphreys had become common,
there was no definite rule as to their disposition; sometimes
they were merely embroidered borders to the neck-opening or
hem, sometimes a vertical strip down the back, less often a
forked cross, the arms of which turned upwards over the
shoulders. From this time onward, however, the embroidery
became ever more and more elaborate, and with this tendency
the orphreys were broadened to allow of their being decorated
with figures. About the middle of the 13th century, the cross
with horizontal arms begins to appear on the back of the vestment,
and by the 15th this had become the most usual form,
though the forked cross also survived&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in England, where
it is now considered distinctive of the chasuble as worn in the
Anglican Church. Where the forked cross is used it is placed
both on the back and front of the vestment; the horizontal-armed
cross, on the other hand, is placed only on the back, the
front being decorated with a vertical strip extending to the
lower hem (fig. 1, <i>b, d</i>). Sometimes the back of the chasuble has
no cross, but only a vertical orphrey, and in this case the front,
besides the vertical stripe, has a horizontal orphrey just below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page960" id="page960"></a>960</span>
the neck opening (see Plate I. fig. 2). This latter is the type
used in the local Roman Church, which has been adopted in
certain dioceses in South Germany and Switzerland, and of
late years in the Roman Catholic churches in England, <i>e.g.</i>
Westminster cathedral (see Plate I. figs. 3 and 5).</p>

<p>It has been widely held that the forked cross was a conscious
imitation of the archiepiscopal pallium (F. Bock, <i>Gesch. der
liturg. Gewänder</i>, ii. 107), and that the chasuble so decorated
is proper to archbishops. Father Braun, however, makes it
quite clear that this was not the case, and gives proof that this
decoration was not even originally conceived as a cross at all,
citing early instances of its having been worn by laymen and
even by non-Christians (p. 210). It was not until the 13th century
that the symbolical meaning of the cross began to be elaborated,
and this was still further accentuated from the 14th century
onward by the increasingly widespread custom of adding to it
the figure of the crucified Christ and other symbols of the Passion.
This, however, did not represent any definite rule; and the
orphreys of chasubles were decorated with a great variety of
pictorial subjects, scriptural or drawn from the stories of the
saints, while the rest of the vestment was either left plain or, if
embroidered, most usually decorated with arabesque patterns
of foliage or animals. The local Roman Church, true to its
ancient traditions, adhered to the simpler forms. The modern
Roman chasuble pictured in Plate I. fig. 5, besides the conventional
arabesque pattern, is decorated, according to rule, with
the arms of the archbishop and his see.</p>

<p><i>The Eastern Church.</i>&mdash;The original equivalent of the chasuble
is the phelonion (<span class="grk" title="phelonion, phelonês, phainolion">&#966;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;, &#966;&#949;&#955;&#972;&#957;&#951;&#962;, &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, from <i>paenula</i>).
It is a full vestment of the type of the Western bell
chasuble; but, instead of being cut away at the sides, it is
for convenience&rsquo; sake either gathered up or cut short in front.
In the Armenian, Syrian, Chaldaean and Coptic rites it is cope-shaped.
There is some difference of opinion as to the derivation
of the vestment in the latter case; the Five Bishops (Report to
Convocation, 1908) deriving it, like the cope, from the <i>birrus</i>,
while Father Braun considers it, as well as the cope, to be a
modification of the <i>paenula</i>.<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The phelonion (Arm. <i>shurtshar</i>,
Syr. <i>phaina</i>, Chald. <i>maaphra</i> or <i>phaina</i>, Copt, <i>burnos, felonion,
kuklion</i>) is confined to the priests in the Armenian, Syrian,
Chaldaean and Coptic rites; in the Greek rite it is worn also by
the lectors. It is not in the East so specifically a eucharistic
vestment as in the West, but is worn at other solemn functions
besides the liturgy, <i>e.g.</i> marriages, processions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Until the 11th century the phelonion is always pictured as a
perfectly plain dark robe, but at this period the custom arose
of decorating the patriarchal phelonion with a number of
crosses, whence its name of <span class="grk" title="polystaurion">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>. By the 14th century
the use of these polystauria had been extended to metropolitans
and later still to all bishops. The purple or black phelonion,
however, remained plain in all cases. The Greeks and Greek
Melchite metropolitans now wear the <i>sakkos</i> instead of the
phelonion; and in the Russian, Ruthenian, Bulgarian and
Italo-Greek churches this vestment has superseded the phelonion
in the case of all bishops (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dalmatic</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>).</p>

<p><a name="ft1i" id="ft1i" href="#fa1i"><span class="fn">1</span></a>  The writer is indebted to the courtesy of Father Braun for the
following note:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Syrian <i>phaina</i> was formerly a closed
mantle of the type of the bell chasuble is clearly proved by the
evidence of the miniatures of a Syrian pontifical (dated 1239) in the
Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris (cf. Bild 16, 112, 284, in <i>Die liturgische
Gewandung</i>). The liturgical vestments of the Armenians are
derived, like their rite, from the Greek rite; so that in this case also
there can be no doubt that the <i>shurtshar</i> was originally closed. The
Coptic rite is in the same relation to the Syrian. Moreover, it would
be further necessary to prove that the <i>birrus</i>, in contradistinction to
the <i>paenula</i>, was always open in front; whereas, <i>per contra</i>, the
<i>paenula</i>, both as worn by soldiers and in ordinary life, was, like the
modern Arab <i>burnus</i>, often slit up the front to the neck. For the
rest, it is obvious that if the Syrian <i>phaina</i> was still quite closed in
the 13th century, and was only provided with a slit since that time,
the same is very probable in the case of the Armenian chasuble.
The absence of the hood might also be taken as additional proof of
the derivation of the <i>phaina</i> from the <i>paenula</i>, but I should not lay
particular stress upon it. The question is settled by the above-mentioned
miniatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAU<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>castellum</i>, fortress, through O. Fr.
<i>chastel, chasteau</i>), the French word for castle (<i>q.v.</i>). The development
of the medieval castle, in the 15th and 16th centuries,
into houses arranged rather for residence than defence led to a
corresponding widening of the meaning of the term <i>château</i>,
which came to be applied to any seigniorial residence and so
generally to all houses, especially country houses, of any pretensions
(cf. the Ger. <i>Schloss</i>). The French distinguish the
fortified castle from the residential mansion by describing the
former as the <i>château fort</i>, the latter as the <i>château de plaisance</i>.
The development of the one into the other is admirably illustrated
by surviving buildings in France, especially in the <i>châteaux</i>
scattered along the Loire. Of these Langeais, still in perfect
preservation, is a fine type of the <i>château fort</i>, with its 10th-century
keep and 13th-century walls. Amboise (1490), Blois
(1500-1540), Chambord (begun 1526), Chenonceaux (1515-1560),
Azay-le-Rideau (1521), may be taken as typical examples of the
<i>château de plaisance</i> of the transition period, all retaining in
greater or less degree some of the architectural characteristics
of the medieval castle. Some description of these is given under
their several headings. In English the word <i>château</i> is often
used to translate foreign words (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Schloss</i>) meaning country
house or mansion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATEAUBRIAND, FRANÇOIS RENÉ,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> <span class="sc">Vicomte de</span> (1768-1848),
French author, youngest son of René Auguste de Chateaubriand,
comte de Combourg,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> was born at St Malo on the 4th of
September 1768. He was a brilliant representative of the reaction
against the ideas of the French Revolution, and the most conspicuous
figure in French literature during the First Empire. His
naturally poetical temperament was fostered in childhood by
picturesque influences, the mysterious reserve of his morose father,
the ardent piety of his mother, the traditions of his ancient family,
the legends and antiquated customs of the sequestered Breton
district, above all, the vagueness and solemnity of the neighbouring
ocean. His closest friend was his sister Lucile,<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> a passionate-hearted
girl, divided between her devotion to him and to religion.
François received his education at Dol and Rennes, where Jean
Victor Moreau was among his fellow-students. From Rennes
he proceeded to the College of Dinan, and passed some years in
desultory study in preparation for the priesthood. He finally
decided, after a year&rsquo;s holiday at the family château of Combourg,
that he had no vocation for the Church, and was on the point of
proceeding to try his fortune in India when he received (1786) a
commission in the army. After a short visit to Paris he joined
his regiment at Cambrai, and early in the following year was
presented at court. In 1788 he received the tonsure in order
to enter the order of the Knights of Malta. In Paris (1787-1789)
he made acquaintance with the Parisian men of letters. He
met la Harpe, Évariste Parny, &ldquo;Pindare&rdquo; Lebrun, Nicolas
Chamfort, Pierre Louis Ginguené, and others, of whom he has
left portraits in his memoirs.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand was not unfavourable to the Revolution in its
first stages, but he was disturbed by its early excesses; moreover,
his regiment was disbanded, and his family belonged to the
party of reaction. His political impartiality, he says, pleased
no one. These causes and the restlessness of his spirit induced
him to take part in a romantic scheme for the discovery of the
North-West Passage, in pursuance of which he departed for
America in the spring of 1791. The passage was not found or
even attempted, but the adventurer returned enriched with the&mdash;to
him&mdash;more important discovery of his own powers and
vocation, conscious of his marvellous faculty for the delineation
of nature, and stored with the new ideas and new imagery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page961" id="page961"></a>961</span>
derived from the virgin forests and magnificent scenery of the
western continent. That he actually lived among the Indians,
however, is shown by Bedier to be doubtful, and the same critic
has exposed the untrustworthiness of the autobiographical
details of his American trip. His knowledge of America was
mainly derived from the books of Charlevoix and others.</p>

<p>The news of the arrest of Louis XVI. at Varennes in June
1791 recalled him to France. In 1792 he married Mlle Céleste
Buisson de Lavigne, a girl of seventeen, who brought him a
small fortune. This enabled him to join the ranks of the emigrants,
a course practically imposed on him by his birth and
his profession as a soldier. After the failure of the duke of
Brunswick&rsquo;s invasion he contrived to reach Brussels, where he
was left wounded and apparently dying in the street. His
brother succeeded in obtaining some shelter for him, and sent
him to Jersey. The captain of the boat in which he travelled
left him on the beach in Guernsey. He was once more rescued
from death, this time by some fishermen. After spending some
time in the Channel Islands under the care of an emigrant uncle,
the comte de Bédée, he made his way to London. In England
he lived obscurely for several years, gaining an intimate acquaintance
with English literature and a practical acquaintance with
poverty. His own account of this period has been exposed
by A. le Braz, <i>Au pays d&rsquo;exil de Chateaubriand</i> (1909), and by
E. Dick, <i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire littéraire de la France</i> (1908), i. From
his English exile dates the <i>Natchez</i> (first printed in his <i>&OElig;uvres
complètes</i>, 1826-1831), a prose epic designed to portray the
life of the Red Indians. Two brilliant episodes originally
designed for this work, <i>Atala</i> and <i>René</i>, are among his most
famous productions. Chateaubriand&rsquo;s first publication, however,
was the <i>Essai historique, politique et moral sur les révolutions ...</i>
(London, 1797), which the author subsequently retracted, but
took care not to suppress. In this volume he appears as a
mediator between royalist and revolutionary ideas, a free-thinker
in religion, and a philosopher imbued with the spirit of
Rousseau. A great change in his views was, however, at hand,
induced, according to his own statement, by a letter from his
sister Julie (Mme de Farcy), telling him of the grief his views
had caused his mother, who had died soon after her release from
the Conciergerie in the same year. His brother had perished
on the scaffold in April 1794, and both his sisters, Lucile and
Julie, and his wife had been imprisoned at Rennes. Mme de
Farcy did not long survive her imprisonment.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand&rsquo;s thoughts turned to religion, and on his
return to France in 1800 the <i>Génie du christianisme</i> was already
in an advanced state. Louis de Fontanes had been a fellow-exile
with Chateaubriand in London, and he now introduced him to
the society of Mme de Staël, Mme Récamier, Benjamin Constant,
Lucien Bonaparte and others. But Chateaubriand&rsquo;s favourite
resort was the salon of Pauline de Beaumont, who was destined
to fill a great place in his life, and gave him some help in the
preparation of his work on Christianity, part of the book being
written at her house at Savigny. <i>Atala, ou les amours de deux
sauvages dans le désert</i>, used as an episode in the <i>Génie du christianisme</i>,
appeared separately in 1801 and immediately made his
reputation. Exquisite style, impassioned eloquence and glowing
descriptions of nature gained indulgence for the incongruity
between the rudeness of the personages and the refinement of
the sentiments, and for the distasteful blending of prudery with
sensuousness. Alike in its merits and defects the piece is a more
emphatic and highly coloured <i>Paul et Virginie</i>; it has been
justly said that Bernardin Saint-Pierre models in marble and
Chateaubriand in bronze. Encouraged by his success the
author resumed his <i>Génie du christianisme, ou beautés de la
religion chrétienne</i>, which appeared in 1802, just upon the eve of
Napoleon&rsquo;s re-establishment of the Catholic religion in France,
for which it thus seemed almost to have prepared the way. No
coincidence could have been more opportune, and Chateaubriand
came to esteem himself the counterpart of Napoleon in
the intellectual order. In composing his work he had borne in
mind the admonition of his friend Joseph Joubert, that the
public would care very little for his erudition and very much
for his eloquence. It is consequently an inefficient production
from the point of view of serious argument. The considerations
derived from natural theology are but commonplaces
rendered dazzling by the magic of style; and the parallels
between Christianity and antiquity, especially in arts and letters,
are at best ingenious sophistries. The less polemical passages,
however, where the author depicts the glories of the Catholic
liturgy and its accessories, or expounds its symbolical significance,
are splendid instances of the effect produced by the accumulation
and judicious distribution of particulars gorgeous in the mass,
and treated with the utmost refinement of detail. The work is
a masterpiece of literary art, and its influence in French literature
was immense. The <i>Éloa</i> of Alfred de Vigny, the <i>Harmonies</i> of
Lamartine and even the <i>Légende des siècles</i> of Victor Hugo may
be said to have been inspired by the <i>Génie du christianisme</i>.
Its immediate effect was very considerable. It admirably subserved
the statecraft of Napoleon, and Talleyrand in 1803
appointed the writer <i>attaché</i> to the French legation at Rome,
whither he was followed by Mme de Beaumont, who died there.</p>

<p>When his insubordinate and intriguing spirit compelled his
recall he was transferred as envoy to the canton of the Valais.
The murder of the duke of Enghien (21st of March 1804) took
place before he took up this appointment. Chateaubriand, who
was in Paris at the time, showed his courage and independence
by immediately resigning his post. In 1807 he gave great
offence to Napoleon by an article in the <i>Mercure de France</i> (4th
of July), containing allusions to Nero which were rightly taken
to refer to the emperor. The <i>Mercure</i>, of which he had become
proprietor, was temporarily suppressed, and was in the next year
amalgamated with the <i>Décade</i>. Chateaubriand states in his
<i>Mémoires</i> that his life was threatened, but it is more than
possible that he exaggerated the danger. Before this, in 1806,
he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, undertaken, as he subsequently
acknowledged, less in a devotional spirit than in quest
of new imagery. He returned by way of Tunis, Carthage, Cadiz
and Granada. At Granada he met Mme de Mouchy, and the
place and the meeting apparently suggested the romantic tale of
<i>Le Dernier Abencérage</i>, which, for political reasons, remained
unprinted until the publication of the <i>&OElig;uvres complètes</i> (1826-1831).
The journey also produced <i>L&rsquo;Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem</i>
... (3 vols., 1811), a record of travel distinguished by the
writer&rsquo;s habitual picturesqueness; and inspired his prose epic,
<i>Les Martyrs, ou le triomphe de la religion chrétienne</i> (2 vols., 1809).
This work may be regarded as the argument of the <i>Génie du
christianisme</i> thrown into an objective form. As in the <i>Epicurean</i>
of Thomas Moore, the professed design is the contrast
between Paganism and Christianity, which fails of its purpose
partly from the absence of real insight into the genius of antiquity,
and partly because the heathen are the most interesting characters
after all. <i>René</i> had appeared in 1802 as an episode of the
<i>Génie du christianisme</i>, and was published separately at Leipzig
without its author&rsquo;s consent in the same year. It was perhaps
Chateaubriand&rsquo;s most characteristic production. The connecting
link in European literature between <i>Werther</i> and <i>Childe
Harold</i>, it paints the misery of a morbid and dissatisfied soul.
The representation is mainly from the life. Chateaubriand betrayed
amazing egotism in describing his sister Lucile in the
Amélie of the story, and much is obviously descriptive of his
own early surroundings. With <i>Les Natchez</i> his career as an imaginative
writer is closed. In 1831 he published his <i>Études ou
discours historiques</i> ... (4 vols.) dealing with the fall of the
Roman Empire.</p>

<p>As a politician Chateaubriand was equally formidable to his
antagonists when in opposition and to his friends when in office.
His poetical receptivity and impressionableness rendered him
no doubt honestly inconsistent with himself; his vanity and
ambition, too morbidly acute to be restrained by the ties of party
allegiance, made him dangerous and untrustworthy as a political
associate. He was forbidden to deliver the address he had prepared
(1811) for his reception to the Academy on M.J. Chénier
on account of the bitter allusions to Napoleon contained in it.
From this date until 1814 Chateaubriand lived in seclusion at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page962" id="page962"></a>962</span>
the Vallée-aux-loups, an estate he had bought in 1807 at Aulnay.
His pamphlet <i>De Bonaparte, des Bourbons, et de la nécessité de se
rattier à nos princes légitimes</i>, published on the 31st of March
1814, the day of the entrance of the allies into Paris, was as
opportune in the moment of its appearance as the <i>Génie du
christianisme</i>, and produced a hardly less signal effect. Louis
XVIII. declared that it had been worth a hundred thousand
men to him. Chateaubriand, as minister of the interior, accompanied
him to Ghent during the Hundred Days, and for a time
associated himself with the excesses of the royalist reaction.
Political bigotry, however, was not among his faults; he rapidly
drifted into liberalism and opposition, and was disgraced in
September 1816 for his pamphlet <i>De la monarchie selon la charte</i>.
He had to sell his library and his house of the Vallée-aux-loups.</p>

<p>After the fall of his opponent, the due Decazes, Chateaubriand
obtained the Berlin embassy (1821), from which he was transferred
to London (1822), and he also acted as French plenipotentiary
at the Congress of Verona (1822). He here made
himself mainly responsible for the iniquitous invasion of Spain&mdash;an
expedition undertaken, as he himself admits, with the idea
of restoring French prestige by a military parade. He next received
the portfolio of foreign affairs, which he soon lost by his
desertion of his colleagues on the question of a reduction of the
interest on the national debt. After another interlude of effective
pamphleteering in opposition, he accepted the embassy to Rome
in 1827, under the Martignac administration, but resigned it at
Prince Polignac&rsquo;s accession to office. On the downfall of the
elder branch of the Bourbons, he made a brilliant but inevitably
fruitless protest from the tribune in defence of the principle of
legitimacy. During the first half of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s reign he was
still politically active with his pen, and published a <i>Mémoire sur
la captivité de madame la duchesse de Berry</i> (1833) and other
pamphlets in which he made himself the champion of the exiled
dynasty; but as years increased upon him, and the prospect
of his again performing a conspicuous part diminished, he relapsed
into an attitude of complete discouragement. His <i>Congrès
de Vérone</i> (1838), <i>Vie de Rancé</i> (1844), and his translation of
Milton, <i>Le Paradis perdu de Milton</i> (1836), belong to the writings
of these later days. He died on the 4th of July 1848, wholly
exhausted and thoroughly discontented with himself and the
world, but affectionately tended by his old friend Madame
Récamier, herself deprived of sight. For the last fifteen years
of his life he had been engaged on his <i>Mémoires</i>, and his chief
distraction had been his daily visit to Madame Récamier, at
whose house he met the European celebrities. He was buried
in the Grand Bé, an islet in the bay of St Malo. Shortly after his
death his memory was revived, and at the same time exposed
to much adverse criticism, by the publication, with sundry
mutilations as has been suspected, of his celebrated <i>Mémoires
d&rsquo;outre-tombe</i> (12 vols., 1849-1850). These memoirs undoubtedly
reveal his vanity, his egotism, the frequent hollowness of his
professed convictions, and his incapacity for sincere attachment,
except, perhaps, in the case of Madame Récamier. Though
the book must be read with the greatest caution, especially in
regard to persons with whom Chateaubriand came into collision,
it is perhaps now the most read of all his works.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand ranks rather as a great rhetorician than as a
great poet. Something of affectation or unreality commonly
interferes with the enjoyment of his finest works. The <i>Génie
du christianisme</i> is a brilliant piece of special pleading; <i>Atala</i>
is marred by its unfaithfulness to the truth of uncivilized human
nature, <i>René</i> by the perversion of sentiment which solicits sympathy
for a contemptible character. Chateaubriand is chiefly
significant as marking the transition from the old classical to the
modern romantic school. The fertility of ideas, vehemence of
expression and luxury of natural description, which he shares
with the romanticists, are controlled by a discipline learnt in the
school of their predecessors. His palette, always brilliant, is
never gaudy; he is not merely a painter but an artist. He is
also a master of epigrammatic and incisive sayings. Perhaps,
however, the most truly characteristic feature of his genius is the
peculiar magical touch which Matthew Arnold indicated as a
note of Celtic extraction, which reveals some occult quality in a
familiar object, or tinges it, one knows not how, with &ldquo;the light
that never was on sea or land.&rdquo; This incommunicable gift
supplies an element of sincerity to Chateaubriand&rsquo;s writings
which goes far to redeem the artificial effect of his calculated
sophistry and set declamation. It is also fortunate for his fame
that so large a part of his writings should directly or indirectly
refer to himself, for on this theme he always writes well. Egotism
was his master-passion, and beyond his intrepidity and the loftiness
of his intellectual carriage his character presents little to
admire. He is a signal instance of the compatibility of genuine
poetic emotion, of sympathy with the grander aspects both of
man and nature, and of munificence in pecuniary matters, with
absorption in self and general sterility of heart.</p>

founded in the 11th century by Brient, count of Penthièvre,
remains of which, consisting of a square donjon and four towers,
still exist. Adjoining it is another castle, built in the first half
of the 16th century by Jean de Laval, and famous in history as
the residence of Françoise de Foix, mistress of Francis I. Of
this the most beautiful feature is the colonnade running at right
angles to the main building, and connecting it with a graceful
pavilion. It is occupied by a small museum and some of the
public offices. There is also an interesting Romanesque church
dedicated to St Jean de Béré. Châteaubriant is the seat of a
subprefect and has a tribunal of first instance. It is an important
centre on the Ouest-État railway, and has trade in agricultural
products. The manufacture of leather, agricultural implements
and preserved angelica are carried on. In 1551 Henry II. signed
an edict against the reformed religion at Châteaubriant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAUDUN,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> a town of north central France, capital of
an arrondissement in the department of Eure-et-Loir, 28 m.
S.S.W. of Chartres by rail. Pop. (1906) 5805. It stands
on an eminence near the left bank of the Loire. The streets,
which are straight and regular, radiate from a central square,
a uniformity due to the reconstruction of the town after
fires in 1723 and 1870. The château, the most remarkable
building in the town, was built in great part by Jean, count of
Dunois, and his descendants. Founded in the 10th century, and
rebuilt in the 12th and 15th centuries, it consists of a principal
wing with a fine staircase of the 16th century, and, at right angles,
a smaller wing adjoined by a chapel. To the left of the courtyard
thus formed rises a lofty keep of the 12th century. The fine
apartments and huge kitchens of the château are in keeping with
its imposing exterior. The church of La Madeleine dates from
the 12th century; the buildings of the abbey to which it belonged
are occupied by the subprefecture, the law court and the
hospital. The medieval churches of St Valérien and St Jean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page963" id="page963"></a>963</span>
and the ruined chapel of Notre-Dame du Champdé, of which the
façade in the Renaissance style now forms the entrance to the
cemetery, are other notable buildings. The public institutions
include a tribunal of first instance and a communal college.
Flour-milling, tanning and leather-dressing, and the manufacture
of blankets, silver jewelry, nails and machinery are the
prominent industries. Trade is in cattle, grain, wool and hemp.
Châteaudun (<i>Castrodunum</i>), which dates from the Gallo-Roman
period, was in the middle ages the capital of the countship of
Dunois.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAU-GONTIER,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> a town of western France, capital of
an arrondissement in the department of Mayenne, on the
Mayenne, 18 m. S. by E. of Laval by road. Pop. (1906) 6871.
Of its churches, that of St Jean, a relic of the castle, dates
from the 11th century. Château-Gontier is the seat of a subprefect
and has a tribunal of first instance, a communal college
for boys and a small museum. It carries on wool- and cotton-spinning,
the manufacture of serge, flannel and oil, and is an
agricultural market. There are chalybeate springs close to the
town. Château-Gontier owes its origin and its name to a castle
erected in the first half of the 11th century by Gunther, the
steward of Fulk Nerra of Anjou, on the site of a farm belonging
to the monks of St Aubin d&rsquo;Angers. On the extinction of the
family, the lordship was assigned by Louis XI. to Philippe de
Comines. The town suffered severely during the wars of the
League. In 1793 it was occupied by the Vendeans.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAUNEUF, LA BELLE,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> the name popularly given to
<span class="sc">Renée de Rieux</span>, daughter of Jean de Rieux, seigneur de
Châteauneuf, who was descended from one of the greatest
families of Brittany. The dates both of her birth and death
are not known. She was maid of honour to the queen-mother
Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, and inspired an ardent passion in the duke
of Anjou, brother of Charles IX. This intrigue deterred the duke
from the marriage which it was desired to arrange for him with
Elizabeth of England; but he soon abandoned La Belle Châteauneuf
for Marie of Cleves (1571). The court then wished to find
a husband for Renee de Rieux, whose singular beauty gave her
an influence which the queen-mother feared, and matches were
in turn suggested with the voivode of Transylvania, the earl of
Leicester, with Du Prat, provost of Paris, and with the count
of Brienne, all of which came to nothing. Ultimately, on the
ground that she had been lacking in respect towards the queen,
Louise of Lorraine-Vaudémont, Renée was banished from the
court. She married a Florentine named Antinotti, whom she
stabbed in a fit of jealousy (1577); then she remarried, her
husband being Philip Altoviti, who in 1586 was killed in a duel
by the Grand Prior Henry of Angoulême, who was himself
mortally wounded.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAU-RENAULT, FRANÇOIS LOUIS DE ROUSSELET,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Marquis de</span> (1637-1716), French admiral, was the fourth son
of the third marquis of Château-Renault. The family was of
Breton origin, but had been long settled near Blois. He entered
the army in 1658, but in 1661 was transferred to the navy, which
Louis XIV. was eager to raise to a high level of strength. After
a short apprenticeship he was made captain in 1666. His early
services were mostly performed in cruises against the Barbary
pirates (1672). In 1673 he was named <i>chef d&rsquo;escadre</i>, and he was
promoted <i>lieutenant général des armées navales</i> in 1687. During
the wars up to this date he had few chances of distinction, but
he had been wounded in action with the pirates, and had been
on a cruise to the West Indies. When war broke out between
England and France after the revolution of 1688, he was in
command at Brest, and was chosen to carry the troops and
stores sent by the French king to the aid of James II. in Ireland.
Although he was watched by Admiral Herbert (Lord Torrington,
<i>q.v.</i>), with whom he fought an indecisive action in Bantry Bay,
he executed his mission with success. Château-Renault commanded
a squadron under Tourville at the battle of Beachy
Head in 1690. He was with Tourville in the attack of the
Smyrna convoy in 1693, and was named grand cross of the
order of Saint Louis in the same year. Though in constant
service, the reduced state of the French navy (owing to the
financial embarrassments of the treasury) gave him few openings
for fighting at sea during the rest of the war.</p>

<p>On the death of Tourville in 1701 he was named to the vacant
post of vice-admiral of France. On the outbreak of the War of
the Spanish Succession he was named for the difficult task of
protecting the Spanish ships which were to bring the treasure
from America. It was a duty of extreme delicacy, for the
Spaniards were unwilling to obey a foreigner, and the French
king was anxious that the bullion should be brought to one of
his own ports, a scheme which the Spanish officials were sure to
resent if they were allowed to discover what was meant. With
the utmost difficulty Château-Renault was able to bring the
galleons as far as Vigo, to which port he steered when he learnt
that a powerful English and Dutch armament was on the Spanish
coast, and had to recognize that the Spanish officers would not
consent to make for a French harbour or for Passages, which they
thought too near France. His fleet of fifteen French and three
Spanish war-ships, having under their care twelve galleons, had
anchored on the 22nd of September in Vigo Bay. Obstacles,
some of an official character, and others due to the poverty of
the Spanish government in resources, arose to delay the landing
of the treasure. There was no adequate garrison in the town,
and the local militia was untrustworthy. Knowing that he
would probably be attacked, Château-Renault strove to protect
his fleet by means of a boom. The order to land the treasure
was delayed, and until it came from Madrid nothing could be
done, since according to law it should have been landed at Cadiz,
which had a monopoly of the trade with America. At last the
order came, and the bullion was landed under the care of the
Gallician militia which was ordered to escort it to Lugo. A very
large part, if not the whole, was plundered by the militiamen
and the farmers whose carts had been commandeered for the
service. But the bulk of the merchandise was on board of the
galleons when the allied fleet appeared outside of the bay on the
22nd of October 1702. Sir George Rooke and his colleagues
resolved to attack. The fleet was carrying a body of troops
which had been sent out to make a landing at Cadiz, and
had been beaten off. The fortifications of Vigo were weak on the
sea side, and on the land side there were none. There was
therefore nothing to offer a serious resistance to the allies when
they landed soldiers. The fleet of twenty-four sail was steered
at the boom and broke through it, while the troops turned the
forts and had no difficulty in scattering the Gallician militia.
In the bay the action was utterly disastrous to the French and
Spaniards. Their ships were all taken or destroyed. The booty
gained was far less than the allies hoped, but the damage done
to the French and Spanish governments was great.</p>

<p>Château-Renault suffered no loss of his master&rsquo;s favour by his
failure to save the treasure. The king considered him free from
blame, and must indeed have known that the admiral had been
trusted with too many secrets to make it safe to inflict a public
rebuke. The Spanish government declined to give him the rank
of grandee which was to have been the reward for bringing home
the bullion safe. But in 1703 he was made a marshal of France,
and shortly afterwards lieutenant-general of Brittany. The
fight in Vigo Bay was the last piece of active service performed
by Château-Renault. In 1708 on the death of his nephew he
inherited the marquisate, and on the 15th of November 1716
he died in Paris. He married in 1684 Marie-Anne-Renée de la
Porte, daughter and heiress of the count of Crozon. His eldest
son was killed at the battle of Malaga 1704, and another, also
a naval officer, was killed by accident in 1708. A third son,
who too was a naval officer, succeeded him in the title.</p>

of a niece of Mazarin. In 1740, upon the death of her husband,

XV.; and by the aid of the duc de Richelieu, who, dominated
by Madame de Tencin, hoped to rule both the king and the state,
she supplanted her sister, Madame de Mailly, as titular mistress
in 1742. Directed by Richelieu, she tried to arouse the king,
dragging him off to the armies, and negotiated the alliance
with Frederick II. of Prussia, in 1744. Her political rôle, however,
has been exaggerated. Her triumph after the passing disgrace
provoked by the king&rsquo;s illness at Metz did not last long, for she
died on the 8th of December 1744.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAUROUX,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> a town of central France, capital of the
department of Indre, situated in a plain on the left bank of the
Indre, 88 m. S. of Orleans on the main line of the Orleans railway.
Pop. (1906) 21,048. The old town, close to the river, forms a
nucleus round which a newer and more extensive quarter,
bordered by boulevards, has grown up; the suburbs of St
Christophe and Déols (<i>q.v.</i>) lie on the right bank of the Indre.
The principal buildings of Châteauroux are the handsome
modern church of St André, in the Gothic style, and the Château
Raoul, of the 14th and 15th centuries; the latter now forms
part of the prefecture. The hôtel de ville contains a library and
a museum which possesses a collection of paintings of the
Flemish school and some interesting souvenirs of Napoleon I.
A statue of General Henri Bertrand (1773-1844) stands in one
of the principal squares. Châteauroux is the seat of a prefect
and of a court of assizes. It has tribunals of first instance and
of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a branch of the Bank
of France, a chamber of commerce, a lycée, a college for girls
and training colleges. The manufacture of coarse woollens for
military clothing and other purposes, and a state tobacco-factory,
occupy large numbers of the inhabitants. Wool-spinning,
iron-founding, brewing, tanning, and the manufacture of agricultural
implements are also carried on. Trade is in wool, iron,
grain, sheep, lithographic stone and leather. The castle from
which Châteauroux takes its name was founded about the
middle of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of Déols, and
during the middle ages was the seat of a seigniory, which was
raised to the rank of countship in 1497, and in 1616, when it
was held by Henry II., prince of Condé, to that of duchy. In
1736 it returned to the crown, and was given by Louis XV. in
1744 to his mistress, Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess of
Châteauroux.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTEAU-THIERRY,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of Aisne, 59 m. E.N.E.
of Paris on the Eastern railway to Nancy. Pop. (1906) 6872.
Château-Thierry is built on rising ground on the right bank of
the Marne, over which a fine stone bridge leads to the suburb
of Marne. On the quay stands a marble statue erected to the
memory of La Fontaine, who was born in the town in 1621;
his house is still preserved in the street that bears his name.
On the top of a hill are the ruins of a castle, which is said to have
been built by Charles Martel for the Frankish king, Thierry IV.,
and is plainly the origin of the name of the town. The chief relic
is a gateway flanked by massive round towers, known as the
Porte Saint-Pierre. A belfry of the 15th century and the church
of St Crépin of the same period are of some interest. The town
is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first instance and
a communal college. The distinctive industry is the manufacture
of mathematical and musical instruments. There is trade in the
white wine of the neighbourhood, and in sheep, cattle and agricultural
products. Gypsum, millstone and paving-stone are quarried
in the vicinity. Château-Thierry was formerly the capital of the
district of Brie Pouilleuse, and received the title of duchy from
Charles IX. in 1566. It was captured by the English in 1421,
by Charles V. in 1544, and sacked by the Spanish in 1591. During
the wars of the Fronde it was pillaged in 1652; and in the campaign
of 1814 it suffered severely. On the 12th of February
of the latter year the Russo-Prussian forces were beaten by
Napoleon in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTELAIN<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (Med. Lat. <i>castellanus</i>, from <i>castellum</i>, a castle),
in France originally merely the equivalent of the English castellan,
<i>i.e.</i> the commander of a castle. With the growth of the feudal
system, however, the title gained in France a special significance
which it never acquired in England, as implying the jurisdiction
of which the castle became the centre. The <i>châtelain</i> was
originally, in Carolingian times, an official of the count; with
the development of feudalism the office became a fief, and so
ultimately hereditary. In this as in other respects the
châtelain was the equivalent of the viscount (<i>q.v.</i>) sometimes
the two titles were combined, but more usually in those provinces
where there were châtelains there were no viscounts, and vice
versa. The title châtelain continued also to be applied to the
inferior officer, or <i>concierge châtelain</i>, who was merely a castellan
in the English sense. The power and status of châtelains
necessarily varied greatly at different periods and places.
Usually their rank in the feudal hierarchy was equivalent to
that of the simple <i>sire</i> (<i>dominus</i>), between the baron and the
<i>chevalier</i>; but occasionally they were great nobles with an
extensive jurisdiction, as in the Low Countries (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Burgrave</a></span>).
This variation was most marked in the cities, where in the struggle
for power that of the châtelain depended on the success with
which he could assert himself against his feudal superior, lay or
ecclesiastical, or, from the 12th century onwards, against the
rising power of the communes. The <i>châtellenie</i> (<i>castellania</i>), or
jurisdiction of the châtelain, as a territorial division for certain
judicial and administrative purposes, survived the disappearance
of the title and office of the châtelain in France, and continued
till the Revolution.</p>

of a châtelaine to carry the keys of the castle suspended from her

often worn by ladies, to which are attached various small
articles of domestic and toilet use, as keys, penknife, needlecase,
scissors, &amp;c.</p>
